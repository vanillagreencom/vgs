# the heading each fragment's own section names, in Keep a Changelog order and
# filename order within a section; it splits the record at the line numbers
# the committed copy was accepted with, collapses two headings for one section
# into one, deletes the fragments and the section directory each leaves empty,
# and refuses without writing when the judgement refuses, the index or working
# tree has pending changes, or the release flag is absent. The refusing
# direction runs first in every pair, and each refusal is checked to have left
# the record and the fragments as they were — a fold that half-writes or
