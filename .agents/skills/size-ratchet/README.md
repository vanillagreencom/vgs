# size-ratchet

A tighten-only gate on file size. New code cannot introduce a tracked file
over its threshold; files already over it are frozen in a baseline at their
current sizes. While a row keeps its unit, its number may only shrink. Growth
is never automated away: the single path to a bigger number is a reviewed
hand edit declared with `RATCHET_RAISE=1`, and a frozen class refuses even
that. Markdown is measured in bytes and code in lines. Flags and exit codes:
`size-ratchet --help`; verdicts: [Semantics](#semantics); internals:
`DEVELOPMENT.md`.

## Usage

```bash
.agents/skills/size-ratchet/scripts/size-ratchet            # check (pre-PR / CI)
.agents/skills/size-ratchet/scripts/size-ratchet --staged   # check what a commit records (git hook)
.agents/skills/size-ratchet/scripts/size-ratchet --update   # tighten the baseline
.agents/skills/size-ratchet/scripts/size-ratchet --seed     # write the FIRST baseline
```

## Semantics

- **Scope**: every tracked file (`git ls-files`), tests included, minus the
  exclusion list and the baseline itself. A policy file cannot carry a row
  for its own size.
- **Units**: a class threshold counts LINES when it is a bare number and
  BYTES when it carries the `k` suffix (`24k` = 24×1024 bytes). Lines are
  newline counts. The shipped list measures markdown in bytes, because a
  re-wrap moves a line count on prose and leaves the byte count alone, and
  everything else in lines.
- **Threshold**: `SIZE_RATCHET_CLASSES` first, then the shipped
  `SIZE_RATCHET_DEFAULT_CLASSES`, then `SIZE_RATCHET_THRESHOLD` (default
  `400` lines), with one inversion on frozen paths. [Path
  classes](#path-classes) states that rule and is the only place that does.
  Every file resolves to exactly one threshold, and every other semantic runs
  per file against it.
- **FAIL** (exit 1) on any of:
  1. **New offender** — a file over its threshold with no baseline row.
  2. **Growth** — a baselined file whose actual size exceeds its row.
  3. **Baseline looser than reality** — a row above the file's actual
     size, a row for a file now at/under its threshold, or a row for a
     file that left the tracked set (deleted, or newly excluded). The
     ratchet must move down; stale slack is a failure, not headroom.
  4. **A row in the wrong unit** — a byte class carrying a line row, or the
     reverse. The number counts something else, so `--update` re-measures it
     instead of comparing it.
  5. **A row added, raised, or changed to another unit against the trusted
     baseline** — see [Trusted HEAD baseline](#trusted-head-baseline).
- **`--staged`** counts index blobs for every tracked file rather than
  preferring the worktree copy: what the commit records is the blob. Use it
  in a pre-commit hook; CI, which checks out a clean tree, does not need it.
  It also runs the `--update` rewrite itself and stages the baseline, so a
  commit that shrinks a limited file passes on the first attempt. Two
  accepted edges, neither of which loosens a row: a `git commit -- <paths>`
  commit acquires the baseline change, and unrelated unstaged row edits in
  the baseline are staged along with it.
- **`--update`** tightens only: it lowers rows to the actual size, re-measures
  rows whose unit no longer matches their class, and removes rows for files
  now at/under their own threshold or no longer counted. It never adds a row
  or raises a number whose unit stayed the same, then re-checks.
- Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` violations, `2` usage/config/collection error.

## Trusted HEAD baseline

Every mode uses one reference. `--baseline` or a process
`SIZE_RATCHET_BASELINE` applies directly; otherwise the settings parser reads
the implicit root and nested sources, tracked `.env.local`, or an explicit
repo-relative source from HEAD. A HEAD symlink at the source path itself is
followed only while its target stays in the repository; one at a parent
component refuses, because HEAD cannot be read through it and a lookup that
could not be performed is not an absent source. An absolute, escaping, or candidate-only
explicit source contributes nothing to the historical lookup; if it assigns
this key, the run refuses because that value has no historical form. The same
rule applies to an untracked `.env.local`. The rows at the selected HEAD path are
the only reference, even when the candidate uses another path or its target
already held dormant rows. Repoint in a commit that changes nothing else, then
change its rows next; the gate does not check that sequence. No rows at the
selected path means a true bootstrap, and the gate says so on its verdict line
rather than reporting a clean raise check.

For a candidate row in the same unit, the reference number is its ceiling. A
larger open row or a first row beside an existing reference set needs
`RATCHET_RAISE=1`; a frozen row never rises. When the units differ, the numbers
are not compared: an open row needs the same declaration, and a frozen row is
admitted only at this run's measurement of the file, and only while that
measurement sits at or below HEAD's blob in the same unit. The gate reads no
commit message, so put the declaration's reason in the commit body.

## Baseline format

`tools/size-ratchet-baseline.tsv` by default (`SIZE_RATCHET_BASELINE` or
`--baseline FILE` to relocate). One row per frozen offender, `path<TAB>size`,
the size suffixed `b` when its class counts bytes:

```
crates/core/src/error.rs	495
docs/handbook.md	86104b
```

Rows are `LC_ALL=C` sorted, paths unique, counts positive. A malformed,
unsorted, or duplicated baseline is a config error (exit 2), not a silent
pass — the file is reviewed input, so it fails loud. A row naming the baseline
itself is stale because the baseline is outside the measured set.

### Seeding a first baseline

`--update` never adds rows, so the first baseline has its own mode:
`size-ratchet --seed` writes every tracked, non-excluded file over its
deciding threshold at its current size, `LC_ALL=C` sorted. It refuses a
selected baseline that already has rows or does not parse. The baseline and
exclusion list must be different plain leaf paths. Either leaf being a symlink
refuses. The baseline's physical parent must stay in the repository; the
exclusion parent is read-only. Their future physical destinations must differ,
including through in-repository parent symlinks. Seed uses
the [trusted HEAD baseline](#trusted-head-baseline) like every other mode: a
true first seed succeeds without `RATCHET_RAISE=1`, while seed after a repoint
is judged against the prior active rows. The seeded file lands uncommitted, so
the initial freeze is still a reviewed diff.

## Path classes

A file's threshold is the **first** entry whose pattern matches its full
repo-relative path across `SIZE_RATCHET_CLASSES`, then
`SIZE_RATCHET_DEFAULT_CLASSES`, else `SIZE_RATCHET_THRESHOLD`. Patterns are
the same shell globs as the exclusion list (`*` crosses `/`), matched by the
same matcher. A pattern cannot contain `;`, which separates entries.

The package ships this list, so a repo that configures nothing still runs it:

| Class | Threshold |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and their nested forms | 24k bytes |
| `*/SKILL.md` | 24k bytes |
| `*/workflows/*.md` | 40k bytes |
| every other `*.md` | 64k bytes |
| `tests/*`, `test/*`, `__tests__/*`, `tests.rs` and their `*/` forms, plus `*test_util.rs`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*` | 800 lines |
| everything else | `SIZE_RATCHET_THRESHOLD`, 400 lines |

A repo overrides a class, never the list: its own entries are matched first,
and the shipped list decides everything they leave alone.

```toml
[env]
SIZE_RATCHET_CLASSES = "*/SKILL.md=32k"
```

**A repo entry never shadows a frozen class.** `*` crosses `/`, so
`ui/*.ts=250` also matches the test files under `ui/`, and a broader
`docs/*=250` reaches documents too. Those paths already have a shipped class
naming them, and the repo never named them: the entry retitles that class
silently, the counting UNIT included, so a `docs/*=250` written for code
judges a byte class in lines. Such an entry is skipped and the shipped class
decides. The rule holds in both directions, a looser repo entry as much as a
tighter one, so no consumer restates a shipped threshold to scope a narrower
policy to one directory:

```toml
[env]
SIZE_RATCHET_CLASSES = "ui/*.ts=250;ui/*.tsx=250"  # ui/ test files stay at 800
```

To move a frozen class deliberately, restate that class's own pattern, as
the `*/SKILL.md` example above does: an entry naming a pattern the shipped
list carries still wins. Where the shipped list names no class for a frozen
path, the repo entry stands.

**This is the only statement of the rule.** Every other surface — the
`--help` text, the block comments, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, the settings table —
names it and points here, because a rule paraphrased in six places loses a
clause in one of them.

The verdict line says what each entry governed. An entry that decided some
paths and was passed over on frozen ones reads `ui/*.ts=250 (yielded on
frozen paths)`; one that decided none reads `(governed nothing: decided no
counted path)`. It reports the state, not the cause: a pattern matching
nothing and a pattern an earlier entry already claimed cannot be told apart,
and an entry passed over on frozen paths reads the same once it decided
nothing, because one reason is enough.

`SIZE_RATCHET_DEFAULT_CLASSES = ""` drops the shipped list; the repo's own
`SIZE_RATCHET_CLASSES` still matches first, so single-threshold behavior
needs both empty.

A directory name takes **both** forms: `*/tests/*` requires a
slash-delimited prefix, so a root-level `tests/` needs its own `tests/*`
entry. The shipped list carries both for every directory pattern it names;
a repo writing its own entries has to do the same.

## Exclusion list

`tools/size-ratchet-excludes` by default (`SIZE_RATCHET_EXCLUDES` or
`--excludes FILE`). One pattern per line, with a mandatory reason —
`pattern<TAB>reason`.

The package applies its own exclusions on top of that list — currently
`CHANGELOG*.md`, where one long file is the documented norm and the entries,
not the file, are what carry a rule.

The pattern is a shell glob matched against the full repo-relative path (`*`
crosses `/`). Blank lines and `#` comments are ignored; a pattern without a
reason is a config error. Typical entries:

```
Cargo.lock	lockfile — generated, size is not a design signal
vendor/*	vendored third-party code
*/fixtures/*	test fixtures — size is the test's business
src/gen/*.rs	generated bindings
```

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SIZE_RATCHET_THRESHOLD` | `400` | Line threshold for paths matching no class. |
| `SIZE_RATCHET_CLASSES` | *(none)* | This repo's overrides, `pattern=threshold` separated by `;`, matched before the shipped list, with one inversion on frozen paths — see [Path classes](#path-classes). |
| `SIZE_RATCHET_DEFAULT_CLASSES` | *(the shipped list)* | The class list the package ships; empty runs with no classes. |
| `SIZE_RATCHET_FROZEN_CLASSES` | *(markdown and tests)* | `;`-separated globs whose rows may never rise; they also decide where the [Path classes](#path-classes) inversion applies. |
| `SIZE_RATCHET_BASELINE` | `tools/size-ratchet-baseline.tsv` | Baseline path. |
| `SIZE_RATCHET_EXCLUDES` | `tools/size-ratchet-excludes` | Exclusion-list path. |

Each key resolves environment > `.env.local` > `.kendex/settings.toml` >
committed `kendex.settings.toml` (flat `KEY = "value"` under `[env]`; other
tables are ignored) > default; a `.env` file is never read, and `.env.local`
uses `KEY=value` or `export KEY=value`, parsed, never sourced. A source that exists but is unusable is a config error
(exit 2), never a fall-through to the next layer. `--baseline` /
`--excludes` override every source for those paths, and an empty value
(`--baseline=`, `--baseline ""`) is a config error, never a silent fall back
to the default path. All relative paths are repo-root-relative; the script
`cd`s to `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` before resolving anything.

`RATCHET_RAISE=1` is not configuration: it is a per-invocation declaration
that this run's added or raised rows are deliberate, read from the
environment alone.

## Requirements

`git`, `awk`, the usual POSIX userland. Bash 3.2 compatible (macOS bash).
