# Size Ratchet

> **Problem with this skill?** Run `kendex report` — it files to the owning repo automatically. Do not hand-file.

**No tracked file gets bigger than its threshold, and files already over
it only shrink.** Existing offenders are frozen in a baseline at their
current line counts; everything else stays at or under its path class's
threshold. Baseline rows only go down or away; a number goes up only by a
human editing the row in a reviewed diff.

```bash
.agents/skills/size-ratchet/scripts/size-ratchet            # check (pre-PR / CI)
.agents/skills/size-ratchet/scripts/size-ratchet --staged   # check what a commit records (git hook)
.agents/skills/size-ratchet/scripts/size-ratchet --update   # tighten the baseline
.agents/skills/size-ratchet/scripts/size-ratchet --seed     # write the FIRST baseline
```

Flags, `SIZE_RATCHET_*` keys, and exit codes: `size-ratchet --help`.
Verdict classes, semantics, baseline/excludes formats, path classes, and
seeding: [README.md](README.md). Collection internals and the migration
note for repos already using this format: [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Responding to a failure

Every diagnostic names the file, its count, the baseline row it violated,
the deciding threshold (class pattern or default), and the remedy: *split
at a concept seam*.

**The ratchet serves cohesion, never defeats it.** The goal is files an
agent can load and reason about whole: one concept per file, whole
concept in the file. A *concept seam* is a boundary where the extracted
file stands alone — its reader never needs the source file open beside
it. Moving half a function, a helper only one caller uses, or "part 2 of
X" into a second file to duck the count is worse than the long file:
prefer the raise.

**Raising a row** (`RATCHET_RAISE=1`, reason in the commit body) is
correct in exactly two cases, both for hand-written files:
1. The added lines are the fix for the reported symptom and the file has
   no concept seam.
2. **Merging fragments**: files that are one concept read together —
   ping-pong calls, a helper file with one importer, "part 2" files —
   are combined back into one, and the merged file's row rises to its
   real size. Shrink or delete the emptied rows in the same diff.

Never raise for tests, docs, comments, or lines a review round asked
for — those either fit, split at a real seam, or do not belong. Generated
and vendored content is never raised either: it is excluded (the
exclusion list, `pattern<TAB>reason`) and leaves the counted set.
