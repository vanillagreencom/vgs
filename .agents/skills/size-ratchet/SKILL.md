# Size Ratchet

Run the document byte-ceiling check before review and in CI. The growth-guards pre-commit chain uses the staged mode.

```bash
.agents/skills/size-ratchet/scripts/size-ratchet
.agents/skills/size-ratchet/scripts/size-ratchet --staged
```

Trim or split an over-limit document. Put an exception in the configured excludes file with a reason. Class selection and the exclusion format are [references/policy.md](references/policy.md). Flags, settings and exit codes are in `size-ratchet --help`.
