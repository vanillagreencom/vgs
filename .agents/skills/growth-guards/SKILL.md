summary: "Ten commit-time guards beside size-ratchet (markers, bytes, suppressions, conflicts, changelog, prose, markdown format and references, comments, commit message) and the git hook shims that run them."

  removal: "kendex guard uninstall, or any kendex CLI verb that drops the package (remove, an apply or refresh that takes it away, marketplace unsubscribe --remove-packages) runs the uninstaller before the files go; it drops only the helper and one marked line, leaving any hook you wrote. Deleting the package any other way leaves shims that exec scripts which are gone and fail every commit closed"
  companions:
    - "size-ratchet"
    - "preflight"
  notes:
    - "A missing companion is announced and skipped, as is a repo-local size-ratchet that rejects --staged and preflight on a first commit; every other companion or guard failure blocks the commit."
    - "Both hooks block on nonzero results; Git's no-verify flag bypasses both for one commit."
    - "Git does not clone hooks; arm every clone once."

# Growth Guards

```bash
.agents/skills/growth-guards/scripts/growth-guards              # batch: every enabled repo check
.agents/skills/growth-guards/scripts/growth-guards all --staged # the same batch at commit scope
.agents/skills/growth-guards/scripts/growth-guards todo-ban     # one check by name, flags pass through
.agents/skills/growth-guards/scripts/md-reflow PATH...          # rewrite markdown to the format md-format judges
.agents/skills/growth-guards/scripts/install-git-hooks          # arm the git pre-commit/commit-msg shims
.agents/skills/growth-guards/scripts/install-git-hooks --check  # read-only: are the shims still armed?
```

## The checks

| Check | Verdict |
|---|---|
| **todo-ban** | Any work marker (TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX in comment-marker shapes) in a tracked, non-excluded file fails. No baseline. |
| **byte-ceiling** | A tracked file over the configured ceiling fails; lockfiles are exempt. |
| **suppression-ban** | Blanket lint suppressions fail; reasonless Rust dead or unused allows may only tighten against the baseline. |
| **conflict-markers** | An unresolved merge-conflict marker in a tracked, non-excluded file fails. |
| **changelog-entries** | Each `GROWTH_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_PATHS` fragment is one Markdown list item in a Keep a Changelog section and at most `GROWTH_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_CAP` characters. |
| **prose** | A history reference in Markdown named by `GROWTH_GUARDS_PROSE_PATHS` fails; `GROWTH_GUARDS_CHECKS` controls whether the lane runs. |
| **md-format** | A hard-wrapped paragraph or list item, a missing blank line around a heading, fence or list, or a trailing-double-space break in Markdown named by `GROWTH_GUARDS_MD_PATHS` fails; `md-reflow` is the remedy. |
| **md-refs** | A relative link, a `<path>.md § Heading` or `<path>.md#anchor` code-span citation, or a decision ID in Markdown named by `GROWTH_GUARDS_MD_REFS_PATHS` that lands on no tracked file, heading or decision fails. |
| **comments** | A history reference in the comment text of a source file named by `GROWTH_GUARDS_COMMENT_PATHS` fails: an issue id (`GH_ISSUE_PATTERN`), `#NNN`, a date, or revision narration. Opt-in: name it in `GROWTH_GUARDS_CHECKS`. |
| **commit-msg** | The header must be `type(scope)!: subject` within `GROWTH_GUARDS_SUBJECT_MAX`; a commit touching `GROWTH_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_REQUIRED_PATHS` also owes a changelog entry or `[no-changelog]`. |

Full check shapes and scopes: [CHECKS.md](CHECKS.md).

Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` violations, `2` usage, configuration, or collection error. An unmerged entry in a scanned path is a collection error.

## Git hooks

Run `scripts/install-git-hooks [--repo PATH]` to arm the shims.

Pre-commit order: `size-ratchet --staged` when installed -> `preflight --staged` when installed -> `growth-guards all --staged` -> `GROWTH_GUARDS_PRE_COMMIT_LOCAL` when configured. `commit-msg` runs the message gate.

Arming and disarming apply to the whole repository. Disarm before removing the skill. Ownership and layering: [README.md § Who gates a commit](README.md#who-gates-a-commit); install mechanics: [DEVELOPMENT.md § Git hook install contract](DEVELOPMENT.md#git-hook-install-contract).

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_CHECKS` | `todo-ban byte-ceiling suppression-ban conflict-markers changelog-entries prose md-format md-refs` | Batch check list (`commit-msg` never batches). |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_TODO_EXCLUDES` | `tools/todo-ban-excludes` | todo-ban exclusion list. |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_BYTE_CEILING_KB` | `200` | Byte ceiling in KB. |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_BYTE_EXCLUDES` | `tools/byte-ceiling-excludes` | byte-ceiling exclusion list (declared asset trees). |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_SUPPRESSION_EXCLUDES` | `tools/suppression-ban-excludes` | suppression-ban exclusion list. |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_SUPPRESSION_BASELINE` | `tools/suppression-baseline.tsv` | Bare-allow ratchet baseline. |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_CONFLICT_EXCLUDES` | `tools/conflict-markers-excludes` | conflict-markers exclusion list. |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_CAP` | `200` | Characters per changelog entry. |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_PATHS` | `changelog.d/*/*.md` | Space-separated globs naming the changelog fragments, matched against the full repo-relative path (`*` crosses `/`). |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_RECORD` | `CHANGELOG.md` | The collated record file; empty switches that scope off. |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_REQUIRED_PATHS` | *(empty)* | Globs whose change obliges a changelog entry, judged by `commit-msg`; empty switches the rule off. |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_PROSE_PATHS` | `SKILL.md */SKILL.md AGENTS.md */AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md */CLAUDE.md workflows/*.md */workflows/*.md agents/*.md */agents/*.md docs/architecture/*.md` | Space-separated globs naming the markdown the prose lane scans, matched against the full repo-relative path (`*` crosses `/`). |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_MD_PATHS` | `*.md` | Globs naming the markdown md-format and md-reflow take under `--all`. |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_MD_REFS_PATHS` | the `GROWTH_GUARDS_PROSE_PATHS` default | Globs naming the markdown md-refs judges under `--all`. |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_MD_EXCLUDES` | `tools/md-excludes` | Exclusion list both markdown lanes honour in every scope, and md-reflow under `--staged` and `--all`. |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_MD_SCOPE` | `touched` | What the markdown lanes judge with neither `--staged` nor `--all`: `touched` is the staged files, and nothing when nothing is staged; `all` is every tracked matching file. |
| `DECISIONS_DIR`, `DECISION_ID_PREFIX`, `DECISION_ID_WIDTH` | `docs/decisions`, `D`, `3` | The decider skill's scheme, read by md-refs to judge decision IDs; IDs are not judged where the directory is not tracked. |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_COMMENT_PATHS` | the extensions in [CHECKS.md § comments](CHECKS.md#comments) | Space-separated globs naming the source files the comments lane scans, matched against the full repo-relative path (`*` crosses `/`); replaces the default. |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_COMMENT_EXCLUDES` | `tools/comments-excludes` | comments exclusion list (generated and vendored trees). `GH_ISSUE_PATTERN` (the github skill's key) is the issue-id shape; empty keeps `[A-Z]+-[0-9]+`. |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_COMMIT_TYPES` | `build chore ci docs feat fix perf refactor revert style test` | Accepted commit types. |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_SUBJECT_MAX` | `72` | Characters allowed in a hand-written commit header. |
| `GROWTH_GUARDS_PRE_COMMIT_LOCAL` | *(empty)* | Repo-root-relative executable the pre-commit shim runs last. |

Settings follow [README.md § Configuration](README.md#configuration). `GROWTH_GUARDS_SETTINGS_FILE=/dev/null` skips file sources; `GROWTH_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_COLLATE=1` is environment-only and bypasses only the record comparison.

**Excludes format.** `pattern<TAB>reason` per line (shell glob against the full repo-relative path; `*` crosses `/`); a pattern without a reason is a config error. A pattern opening with `!` carves its matches back into the scanned set, and wins over every exclusion row whatever the order. That is how hand-written source inside an otherwise excluded render tree (`.agents/**` plus `!.agents/skills/my-skill/**`) stays governed. To exclude a path that literally begins with `!`, escape it: `\!foo`. **Baseline format.** `path<TAB>count`, `LC_ALL=C` sorted, unique paths, positive counts. Seeding a first baseline and CI wiring: [README.md](README.md). Hook install and removal details: [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).
