# growth-guards checks

What each check bans and how it is scoped. The package overview, the
invocation forms and the git hooks are in [README.md](README.md); every
configuration key is in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md).

## todo-ban

Flat ban on work markers in first-party tracked files — the words TODO,
FIXME, HACK, XXX in comment-marker shapes, no baseline. Prose that quotes or
names a marker does not fire; matching is case-sensitive. Do the work now or
track it and delete the marker; vendored trees go in excludes with a reason.

## byte-ceiling

Tracked files a change puts over the ceiling (default 200 KB, KB = 1024
bytes) fail. Growth-oriented like size-ratchet — default modes gate no
legacy file a change leaves alone, so adoption needs no cleanup first.
Lockfiles are exempt built-in by exact basename; declared asset trees go in
excludes with a reason.

- `--staged` (default) — files added, changed, or type-changed in the staged
  diff (pre-commit). Editing a committed file past the ceiling puts the same
  bytes in history as adding one, so the staged lane judges both; rename
  detection is held to exact content, so a file that moved and grew is
  judged at its new path.
- `--base REF` — files added since the merge-base with REF (CI on a PR).
- `--all` — every tracked file (audits; pair with excludes rows).

## suppression-ban

Two gates, both scanned language-scoped by pathspec, so docs and scripts
that quote a pragma never fire. **Blanket suppressions fail flat** —
module/crate-wide rust `#![allow(...)]` inner attributes, file-level
`# ruff: noqa` / `# flake8: noqa`, the bare `/* eslint-disable */` block
form, `//nolint` bare or `:all`, and — over biome's JS/TS family plus CSS
and JSONC — `biome-ignore-all`, unscoped `biome-ignore-start`, and
rule-less `biome-ignore lint` / group forms. A per-line suppression naming
its lint with a stated reason stays legal (`# noqa: E501`,
`// eslint-disable-next-line rule -- why`, `//nolint:gosec // why`,
`// biome-ignore lint/<group>/<rule>: why`, a per-item rust attribute).

**Bare-allow ratchet (Rust)** — reasonless `#[allow(dead_code)]` /
`#[allow(unused…)]` attributes are counted per file; an attribute carrying
`reason = "..."` does not count. Legacy counts freeze in a tighten-only
baseline: new bare allows, growth past a row, and a baseline looser than
reality all fail. `--update` lowers/removes rows and re-checks; it never
adds a row and never raises one, so deliberate growth — and the first
baseline, hand-turned from the reported `new bare allow` lines into
`LC_ALL=C`-sorted `path<TAB>count` rows — is a hand-edit, visible in review.

## conflict-markers

Flat ban on unresolved merge-conflict markers: the open/base/close trio
(seven `<`, seven vertical bars, seven `>`) at column 0, each followed by a
space or end of line. Indented or quoted occurrences never fire; neither
does bare `=======` — a valid Markdown setext underline (a real conflict
always carries the open and close markers).

## commit-msg

Conventional-commit gate over one message, shaped for the git `commit-msg`
hook (`commit-msg FILE`, or stdin when FILE is absent/`-`). The header — the
first non-blank, non-comment line — must match `type(scope)!: subject`, the
scope and `!` optional. Types come from `GROWTH_GUARDS_COMMIT_TYPES`; the
scope class `[#A-Za-z0-9 _.,/-]+` passes uppercase issue keys
(`fix(ABC-123): ...`) and issue numbers (`fix(#123): ...`).
