# growth-guards — development notes

Internals, design, and maintenance for the growth-guards skill. Consumer
docs live in README.md.

## Structure

- `scripts/growth-guards` — batch dispatcher and single-check router
- `scripts/todo-ban`, `scripts/byte-ceiling`, `scripts/suppression-ban`,
  `scripts/conflict-markers`, `scripts/commit-msg` — the five checks, each a
  standalone executable
- `scripts/pre-commit` — the chain the git `pre-commit` shim runs
- `scripts/install-git-hooks` — hook installer, remover, and `--check` verdict
- `scripts/lib/common.sh`, `scripts/lib/settings.sh` — shared helpers and
  layered settings resolution
- `kendex.settings.toml.example` — settings template for consumers
- `SKILL.md` — agent-facing skill definition
- `README.md` — consumer documentation
- `tests/` — run any file directly; every suite sources the harness first
- `tests/lib/harness.bash` — the scratch root a suite owns, a `TMPDIR`
  inside it, and git-config isolation; sourced, so the name stays outside
  the `tests/*.sh` glob runners execute

`bash tests/*.sh` is the lane `tools/validate-changed` derives for a change
under this skill.

## Design

One idiom throughout — language-agnostic where possible, tighten-only
baselines only where legacy counts exist, every failure carries its
remediation, every exclusion carries its reason — and one exit contract:
`0` clean, `1` violations, `2` usage/config/collection error. A measurement
that fails (unreadable file, a git/grep execution failure) is a loud exit 2,
never a silent pass. Scans read INDEX content (`git grep --cached` / staged
blobs) so the gate judges what is being committed, and a sparse checkout
cannot hide a tracked file from it.

## Git hook install contract

The installer writes three files into the repository's `.git/hooks` (never
`core.hooksPath`, which redirects the whole directory and would disable the
repository's existing hooks; where a repo already sets it, the install is a
reported skip and only removal still runs):

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `kendex-guards` | Helper the installer owns outright and rewrites on every run. |
| `pre-commit` | One marked line delegating to the helper — created, or inserted after the shebang of an existing hook. |
| `commit-msg` | Same, passing git's message file through. |

The line goes FIRST, not last: hook content ending in an explicit `exit`
would leave an appended guard unreachable. Ours runs, blocks on any nonzero,
and then falls through to whatever the hook already did — whose own exit
status still decides.

Repeat runs are no-ops, and repairs. A hook counts as current only when it
carries the EXACT delegating line on a line of its own — a line that was
commented out, truncated, or left behind by an older version is rewritten,
not trusted — and a hook whose executable bit was cleared gets it back,
because git silently ignores a hook it cannot execute. An existing
`pre-commit`/`commit-msg` keeps its content and its own exit status; a hook
that is symlinked, deliberately disabled (not executable), or whose shebang
names an interpreter that is not a POSIX-compatible shell is left alone
entirely (reported, and the install exits 1). A file at the helper path that
this installer did not write is never overwritten. A bare repository is
refused — there is no work tree to guard.

Linked worktrees share the install, since git resolves their hooks to the
main checkout's hooks directory. The same sharing governs removal: while any
work tree on that hooks directory still has a SEPARATE install of the skill,
`--uninstall` keeps the shims, retargets the helper at that surviving
install, and says so. Separate is decided by physical path — a worktree
whose skills directory links back into the checkout being uninstalled from
is the same install, and it is going away.

`--uninstall` drops the helper and our marked line from each hook, deleting
a hook file this installer created outright and leaving every other line of
a consumer's own hook untouched. It runs even where `core.hooksPath` is set
— shims left in `.git/hooks` come back to life the moment that setting goes
away. A delegating line it may not edit (a symlinked hook) keeps the helper
in place and fails the removal rather than stranding a hook with no guard to
reach. `kendex remove growth-guards` refuses the removal if that cleanup
fails, so removing the skill never leaves hooks that block every commit.

`--check` is the read-only counterpart: it writes nothing — not even the
hooks directory — and answers whether the shims are armed. `0`: the helper
and both hooks pass the same predicate an install trusts (regular file, our
marker or exact line at its position, POSIX-sh shebang, executable). `1`:
some shim is drifted or absent. `2`: the question could not be answered (an
unreadable hooks directory, a hook file that cannot be read); failure to
measure is never a pass, and definitive drift outranks an unmeasured
component. The one stdout line carries every component finding, and `kendex
check` folds it in for projects with the skill installed.

Under `core.hooksPath` the redirected directory is what `--check` probes,
because it is the only one git reads. The target is resolved with `git
rev-parse --git-path hooks` — git's own hook resolver, so an absolute, a
`~`-prefixed and a work-tree-relative value all land where git lands, from a
subdirectory as well as from the root. Its `pre-commit` and `commit-msg` are
armed in exactly two shapes, matched over the WHOLE FILE rather than
searched for: the delegating line this installer writes, beside a helper in
that same directory — that line resolves its helper through git, which under
`core.hooksPath` answers with this directory and not `.git/hooks` — or a
hook that is a shebang, comments, and exactly ONE command, and that command
is this skill's entry point for the hook (optionally through `exec`,
optionally quoted). The argument list is checked as well, and it differs
per hook: `pre-commit` takes none, so empty or `"$@"`; `commit-msg` needs
git's message-file path, so `"$1"` or `"$@"`. Either may be followed by
`|| exit $?`. A tail outside that set is what makes `exec …/pre-commit
--help` and `…/pre-commit "$@" || true` gate nothing while naming the entry
point in command position — and swapping the two hooks' forms is worse than
loose: `pre-commit "$1"` exits 2 on the argument it refuses, and a bare
`commit-msg` reads inherited stdin and calls every message empty, so both
reject valid commits while validating nothing.

Two more conditions before `armed`: the entry point must resolve to a real
executable file, because a path merely SHAPED like one leaves git answering
every commit with command-not-found; and the hook's shebang must carry no
interpreter option, because `#!/bin/sh -n` syntax-checks the body and exits
0, running no guard at all. The shared shebang check stays permissive for a
repo's own hooks; this one does not.

When the command IS the entry point and only the argument list falls outside
the allowlist — a trailing comment, an extra argument — the answer is `2`,
not `1`. Such a hook may gate perfectly well, and `1` would state the
opposite. `1` is reserved for a hook whose single command is not the entry
point at all, or whose entry-point path resolves to nothing.

An entry-point path whose FINAL COMPONENT is a symlink is `2` as well. The
path suffix identifies the guard only while that component is the guard, and
a link to `/bin/true` passes every file test while gating nothing. Only the
final component is tested, so a symlinked parent directory still resolves to
a real installation, because the candidate is compared by PHYSICAL LOCATION
against this install's own entry point, not by the shape of its path. A path
is a name and any executable can wear it: a copy of `/bin/true` at
`…/growth-guards/scripts/pre-commit` passes every file test and gates
nothing. The INTERPRETER is identified the same way — by full path against a
short trusted list (`/bin` and `/usr/bin` shells) — because an executable
named `sh` anywhere can be a copy of `/bin/true`, and git then runs it and
ignores the hook body entirely. An `env` shebang resolves through PATH, so
it is unverifiable rather than armed, and a listed path that does not exist
on this host is unverifiable too — git cannot exec such a hook at all. The delegating shape's helper is
compared BYTE FOR BYTE against what this installer generates whenever it
sits outside the installer-owned hooks directory, because there the marker
is only a comment; `helper_body` is the single definition both the writer
and the verifier use. The comparison runs in `.git/hooks` as well: `--check`
writes nothing, so it cannot assume the installer has just refreshed the
copy it is looking at.

The command's SPELLING is checked too: only a word that survives shell
evaluation unchanged can be compared against a file on disk. Single-quoted
paths qualify; `$`, a backtick or a backslash under double quotes does not,
and an unquoted word additionally globs and expands `~`. A checkout path
literally containing `$slot` passed every file test while `/bin/sh` ran
whatever `slot` pointed at.

Everywhere this grammar treats whitespace, it means BLANKS — space and tab —
never `[[:space:]]`. The shell separates tokens on blanks and keeps every
other whitespace character as part of the word, so treating them alike
silently repairs a hook that git cannot run. It matters in three places, and
the reasoning is the same in all three:

- the TAIL — a tail counts only when a blank separates it from the command,
  because `"…/commit-msg""$1"` is a single word git cannot run, and a line
  ending in CR is unverifiable rather than accepted for a tail the shell
  never sees;
- the SHEBANG — `#!/bin/sh` followed by CR makes the kernel look for an
  interpreter named `/bin/sh\r`;
- the INDENTATION — a line beginning with CR runs a command named `\rexec`,
  so stripping it as leading whitespace would accept a hook that fails every
  commit.

A control character anywhere in a command line makes the shape unverifiable
outright, for the same reason.

The grammar is closed on purpose. Accepting the entry point anywhere it
looks executable means ruling on reachability, which needs a shell parser:
`if false; then … fi`, a function body nothing calls, and a `<<-` heredoc
with an indented terminator all put the entry point on a line that reads as
a command and never runs. Guessing there fails OPEN — it reports gating that
no commit gets — so a hook outside the grammar is answered `2`, `could not
determine`, naming the shape that is recognized. Never `0`, and never `1`
either: a hook that runs `set -e` before the entry point does gate, and
calling it ungated is the same false answer pointing the other way.

A recognizable hook that is simply not ours — one command, and it is some
other tool — is `1` with the hand-wiring remedy, as is a missing or
non-executable one. A target that cannot be read is `2`. Every shim in
`.git/hooks` intact but dormant behind the redirect stays `1` with its own
wording, because no commit runs a guard right now.

## The pre-commit chain

`scripts/pre-commit` judges ONE commit snapshot — staged content, and
tracked configuration read from the index, so an unstaged edit cannot switch
a check off for content the commit keeps. It runs `size-ratchet --staged`
and `preflight --staged` when the committing work tree or this install
carries those skills — the work tree's copy wins, so a shim exec'ing a shared
install in another checkout still gates on this tree's own copies (a
repository's first commit skips preflight with a note — nothing to diff
against; a size-ratchet that rejects `--staged` in its own first-line parser
diagnostic is a repo-local replacement — stated skip, that repo's own wiring
owns the gate — while any other failure blocks as a guard that could not
run), then the `growth-guards` batch over the staged content, then the
repo-local entry named by `GROWTH_GUARDS_PRE_COMMIT_LOCAL`. Every step runs
before the verdict, so one attempt reports every blocker.

The shims fail closed on `2` for a guard that could not run — an uninstalled
script, a missing helper, a missing repo-local entry — naming what is
missing.

## todo-ban marker shapes

No baseline: consumer repos are at or near zero, so the count starts frozen
at nothing. A marker word counts only in marker shapes:

- the word at line start, after whitespace, or after a comment leader,
  immediately followed by `:` or `(` — the classic annotated forms
  (`MARKER: fix this`, `MARKER(owner): fix this`);
- the bare word directly after a comment leader (only whitespace between),
  followed by whitespace or end of line.

Comment leaders: `//`, `#`, `;`, `/*`, `<!--`. A marker preceded by a
backtick, a quote, or joined text (documentation quoting the word, a regex
listing the words, `\n` inside a string literal) matches neither shape.
Matching is case-sensitive — lowercase uses of the words are prose.

## byte-ceiling sizing

Sizes are object sizes (`git cat-file -s` of the added blob): the bytes that
actually enter history, independent of worktree state. Rename detection is
pinned on, so moving an existing large file is not an addition; a copy is
one (it duplicates the bytes in the tree). Symlinks and submodule gitlinks
are not sized content.

Exempt built-in (exact basename): `Cargo.lock`, `package-lock.json`,
`npm-shrinkwrap.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lock`,
`bun.lockb`, `flake.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`,
`Gemfile.lock`, `composer.lock`, `go.sum`, `gradle.lockfile`,
`packages.lock.json`, `Package.resolved`.

## suppression-ban patterns

Blanket suppressions are scanned language-scoped by pathspec, so docs and
scripts that quote a pragma never fire:

| Language | Pathspec | Banned shape |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | `*.rs` | module/crate-wide inner attribute `#![allow(...)]` at line start |
| Python | `*.py` | file-level `# ruff: noqa` / `# flake8: noqa` (own-line, with or without codes) |
| JS/TS | `*.js *.jsx *.ts *.tsx *.mjs *.cjs *.mts *.cts *.vue *.svelte` | bare block `/* eslint-disable */` with no rules named |
| Go | `*.go` | `//nolint` with nothing after it, or `//nolint:all` |

The bare-allow ratchet counts matching lines per file; an attribute carrying
`reason = "..."` does not count — stating the reason is the legal form.
`--update` never adds a row, so the first baseline is hand-authored from the
reported `new bare allow` lines: the initial freeze being a hand-authored,
reviewed diff is the point.

## Settings sources

Env files use `KEY=value` or `export KEY=value`; they are parsed, never
sourced. Only an ABSENT source is skipped: a source that exists but is
unusable — unreadable, a directory, FIFO, socket or device, or a symlink
that does not resolve — is a config error (exit 2), never a fall-through to
the next layer. `GROWTH_GUARDS_SETTINGS_FILE=/dev/null` selects no settings
source at all — `.env.local`, the settings file and `.env` are all skipped —
leaving explicit environment variables and the built-in defaults. The
scripts `cd` to `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` before resolving anything,
so all relative paths are repo-root-relative.

**Excludes format** (all four lists): `pattern<TAB>reason` per line — shell
glob matched against the full repo-relative path (`*` crosses `/`); blank
lines and `#` comments ignored; a pattern without a reason is a config
error. **Baseline format**: `path<TAB>count`, `LC_ALL=C` sorted, unique
paths, positive counts; malformed, unsorted, or duplicated rows are config
errors (exit 2), never repaired silently.
