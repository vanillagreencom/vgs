# shellcheck shell=bash
# How a lane scoped by a glob list over repo-relative paths finds its content
# and decides what it may measure: the glob list, the walk over the index
# records, and the classification of every shape at a configured path that is
# not the content the lane reads.
#
# TWO glob lists, one matcher. A lane names the paths it is FOR with a
# configured list, and names the paths it is NOT for with an excludes file
# read out of the index. Both are shell globs over the full repo-relative
# path and both go through gg_path_matches, so the two answers cannot come
# from two spellings; the excludes half sits at the foot of this file.
#
# Sourced by lib/common.sh, never executed; the family contract and every
# helper it leans on (gg_config_error, gg_config_path, gg_require_merged_index,
# gg_shown) live there.
#
# Bash 3.2-safe throughout, like its parent.

# --- configured path globs: one setting naming a space-separated list -------
# The lanes scoped by a PATH LIST rather than by an excludes file share this.
# Each pattern goes through the family's path discipline — absolute, escaping
# and '-'-leading values are configuration errors, never a glob that quietly
# matches nothing — and an empty list is one too: a check that measures
# nowhere while reporting OK is the silent pass this family refuses, and
# dropping the check from GROWTH_GUARDS_CHECKS is how it is turned off.
#
# The caller runs under `set -f`. The list is word-split, and pathname
# expansion would resolve each pattern against the WORK TREE — matching
# whatever happens to be checked out instead of the tracked paths the scan
# judges, and matching nothing at all in a sparse or bare checkout.

# A setting holding a LIST of path globs, validated the way one path is. The
# caller word-splits the result, so every check that reads a glob list applies
# the same path discipline: absolute, escaping and '-'-leading entries are
# configuration errors rather than globs that quietly match nothing. An empty
# result means the setting named nothing — the caller decides whether that is
# a switched-off check or an error.

# --- one walk over the configured paths -------------------------------------

# -s` records, the glob match, and the shapes at a configured path that are
# not the content the lane measures — a symlink, a submodule gitlink, and a
# blob git would call binary. Each of those is a path a `--cached` scan drops
# with NO status and NO stderr, so a lane that let one through would print a
# clean verdict over content it never read. Each is NAMED here and counted
# apart from the clean total, in GG_WALK_SKIPPED.
#
# Needs gg_tmpdir and the configured globs already loaded. ON_FILE runs in
# the caller's own shell, as `ON_FILE PATH BLOBFILE`, so it may set the
# caller's counters.
#
# The tally is of PATHS, which is what the verdict line claims — and one path
# reaches the sniff once per scan that lists it, so a check running several
# lanes over overlapping pathspecs meets the same unreadable blob several
# times. The paths already named are kept in $GG_TMP/skipped.z, NUL-delimited
# so a path holding any byte but NUL round-trips exactly; a repeat is neither
# printed again nor counted again, and the reason it carries is the first
# one it was given. The file lives beside the counter and is emptied wherever
# the counter is reset, so the two always describe the same run.
