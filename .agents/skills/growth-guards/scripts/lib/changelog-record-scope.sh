# It runs after that walk, on the globals the walk filled in (RECORD_SHA and
# RECORD_MODE), and reports the way the walk does: a violation counted in
# `violations`, a collection error for a measurement that could not run, and
# RECORD_NOTE saying which way the scope stood down when it did.
#
# Its own file because the two scopes share nothing but their verdict: this
# one is about a file's [Unreleased] section against HEAD's, and the walk is
# about what a fragment tree may hold.

# the one deciding whether an absent index entry is a deletion, and the one
# taking HEAD's copy to compare against — and a second spelling of this probe
# is a second answer waiting to disagree with the first.
