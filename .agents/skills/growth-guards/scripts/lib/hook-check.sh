# helper ours, does each hook still carry our line, and what does the hooks
# directory add up to. Read-only throughout — nothing here writes.
#
# One directory, $HOOKS_DIR, because that is the only one this package
# writes: a core.hooksPath naming any other is answered by the caller as
# unverifiable before anything here is asked.
#
# Sourced by install-git-hooks, which owns the marker constants, the shebang
# predicates, and the helper_body it compares against.
# Strict on its own terms rather than on its caller's: a reader of one of
# these functions should not have to go find out which shell options were
# on when the file was read.

# --check: nothing below this comment's section writes. Component findings
# are folded into the single stdout verdict line, so a caller that sees only
# the summary still learns what is wrong and where. The remedy is the other
# stream's: a core.hooksPath stand-down puts git's report on stderr, because
# it is as many lines as git gives and stdout stays one line.
