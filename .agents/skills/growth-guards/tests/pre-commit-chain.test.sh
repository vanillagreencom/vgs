# in another checkout whose branch state says nothing about this commit), a
# genuine double absence is a stated skip naming both probed sides, and the
# repo-local lane announces itself even when nothing is configured. Every
# firing pin is paired with the control that proves the fixture, not the
# chain, would otherwise pass.
