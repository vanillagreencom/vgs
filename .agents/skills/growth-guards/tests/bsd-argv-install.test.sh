# growth-guards installs on macOS, where the utilities are BSD, not GNU. That
# used to be a text scan for the shapes a BSD utility rejects, and it was
# wrong four times running: each spelling missed an argument form the next
# reviewer found, because a lint over shell source has no bottom — the same
# command can be written in more ways than a regex can enumerate.
#
# So it is not read any more, it is RUN. The BSD rule is put in a shim on
# PATH and the real installer executes under it, which cannot be evaded by
# spelling: whatever the scripts call chmod with, the shim judges it the way
# macOS would. The merge-group macOS lane stays the platform proof; this is
# what every Linux run can say on its own.
#
# Bash 4 syntax in the shipped scripts is `tools/bash32-lint`, run over the
# roster `tools/bash32-lint --list` prints.
