# Harness CI

**One question, one answer: is this diff nothing but kendex render output?** The classifier reads a diff's changed-file set and prints `harness_only=true` when every path sits under `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.opencode/`, `.cursor/`, `.pi/`, or is the root `opencode.json`, or `opencode.jsonc` where a project carries that spelling. Anything else prints `false`, and so does every diff the classifier cannot read. A path the selected head tree's manifests (`kendex.toml`, and `kendex-local.toml` where a source catalog keeps its installs) declare in place, `.agents/skills/<name>` under `[skills.<name>] source = "in-place"`, and any `.agents/hooks/` script are project source, never render output.

```bash
.agents/skills/harness-ci/scripts/harness-only \
  --event pull_request --base "$BASE_SHA" --head "$HEAD_SHA"
```

Flags and exit codes: `harness-only --help`. Contract and semantics: [README.md](README.md). Workflow shapes to copy: [references/wiring.md](references/wiring.md).

## This package never edits a workflow

Nothing here writes `.github/`. Wire the one step yourself, once, from [references/wiring.md](references/wiring.md).

## The rules to hold when wiring it

**Classify inside a job, never in `on.<event>.paths`.** A path filter stops the workflow from starting, the required context is never created, and a merge queue waits forever on a check nothing will report.

**Keep the required-context job unconditional.** Gate the expensive lanes with a job-level `if:` off a `changes` job's output, or a step-level `if:` inside an aggregate, and let the aggregate that carries the required name run on every event.

**A job-level `if:` needs a status function.** Without one it keeps the implicit `success()` and skips the lane whenever the classifying job failed, which stands the expensive lanes down on exactly the diffs nothing classified. An aggregate accepts a `skipped` lane only after checking that the classifier ran and cleared the diff.

**A lane reading a path family beside the verdict needs more than the status function.** A dead classifying job publishes no outputs, so the family term reads empty and skips the lane on its own. Lift it behind `needs.changes.result != 'success'`, the two-gate shape in [references/wiring.md](references/wiring.md).

## Reading a verdict

`stdout` is the verdict line alone; changed paths and reasons go to `stderr`; exit `2` is a wiring error that prints no verdict. [README.md](README.md) § Semantics.

## Fail-closed

Every unprovable case answers `false`, which runs every lane ([README.md](README.md) § Fail-closed). `--no-renames` is fixed.
