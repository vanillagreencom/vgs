# Harness CI

> **Problem with this skill?** Run `kendex report` — it files to the owning repo automatically. Do not hand-file.

**One question, one answer: is this diff nothing but kendex render
output?** The classifier reads a diff's changed-file set and prints
`harness_only=true` when every path sits under `.agents/`, `.claude/`,
`.codex/`, `.opencode/`, `.cursor/`, `.pi/`, or is the root
`opencode.json` — `opencode.jsonc` where a project carries that spelling.
Anything else prints `false`, and so does every diff the classifier cannot
read. A path the selected head tree's manifests (`kendex.toml`, and
`kendex-local.toml` where a source catalog keeps its installs) declare in
place —
`.agents/skills/<name>` under `[skills.<name>] source = "in-place"` — and
any `.agents/hooks/` script are project source, never render output.

```bash
.agents/skills/harness-ci/scripts/harness-only \
  --event pull_request --base "$BASE_SHA" --head "$HEAD_SHA"
```

Flags and exit codes: `harness-only --help`. Contract and semantics:
[README.md](README.md). Workflow shapes to copy:
[references/wiring.md](references/wiring.md).

## This package never edits a workflow

The classification function is portable; the wiring is not. A package that
installed itself into `.github/workflows/` would rename jobs, drop required
contexts, and wedge merge queues in repositories it knows nothing about.

The contract is one thin step the consumer writes and owns, calling the
rendered script. Adoption edits the consumer's workflow by hand, once.

## The rules to hold when wiring it

**Classify inside a job, never in `on.<event>.paths`.** A path filter stops
the workflow from starting, the required context is never created, and a
merge queue waits forever on a check nothing will report.

**Keep the required-context job unconditional.** Gate the expensive lanes —
job-level `if:` off a `changes` job's output, or step-level `if:` inside an
aggregate — and let the aggregate that carries the required name run on every
event.

**A job-level `if:` needs a status function.** Without one it keeps the
implicit `success()` and skips the lane whenever the classifying job failed,
which stands the expensive lanes down on exactly the diffs nothing classified.
An aggregate accepts a `skipped` lane only after checking that the classifier
ran and cleared the diff.

**A lane reading a path family beside the verdict needs more than the status
function.** A dead classifying job publishes no outputs, so the family term
reads empty and skips the lane on its own. Lift it behind
`needs.changes.result != 'success'` — the two-gate shape in
[references/wiring.md](references/wiring.md).

## Reading a verdict

`stdout` carries the verdict line alone, so `$(harness-only …)` is safe to
read directly. The changed paths and the reason behind a `false` go to
`stderr`, where the job log shows them. `--output FILE` (default
`$GITHUB_OUTPUT`) appends the same line for a step output.

Exit `0` accompanies every verdict, `true` or `false`. Exit `2` is a wiring
error — an unknown flag, a missing `--event`, a flag where a value belongs, an
`--output` the process cannot append to — and prints nothing on stdout,
turning the step red instead of passing a guess off as a classification.

## Fail-closed

Every unprovable case answers `false`, which runs every lane:

- an event outside `pull_request`, `merge_group`, `push`
- a missing, empty, or unresolvable endpoint, the all-zero sha included
- a diff git cannot read
- an empty changed-file set
- a path git had to quote, which no harness prefix matches

`--no-renames` is not tunable. With rename detection on, a product file
moved into a render tree lists only its post-image, the diff reads as
render-only, and the lanes that would have judged the deletion never run.
