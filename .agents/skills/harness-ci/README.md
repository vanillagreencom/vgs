# harness-ci

One function for a repository that commits its kendex render: changed paths in, `harness_only=true|false` out, so CI can stand its expensive lanes down on a diff that touches nothing it builds, lints, typechecks or tests. Opt-in: a repository that wants CI over its harness directories does not install it.

## Install

```bash
kendex add vanillagreencom/kendex --skill harness-ci
```

Install with the default symlink delivery, which writes the shared `.agents/skills/harness-ci/` tree every wiring example names. Copy delivery writes a tree per harness and no `.agents` tree, so a repository on it points its step at whichever tree it committed.

## What it does

- Classifies a diff between two commits as render-only or not.
- Treats content the repository authors inside the render trees as product source: a skill its manifest declares `source = "in-place"`, and any script under `.agents/hooks`.
- Answers `false` for anything it cannot prove, which runs every lane.
- Ships workflow shapes to copy, and the tests that pin the semantics, run in kendex CI.

## How it works

```bash
.agents/skills/harness-ci/scripts/harness-only \
  --event pull_request --base "$BASE_SHA" --head "$HEAD_SHA"
```

The consumer owns one thin step calling the rendered script, written by hand once from [references/wiring.md](references/wiring.md); the package never touches `.github/`, because a workflow installed into a stranger's CI renames jobs, drops required contexts and wedges merge queues. Checkout with `fetch-depth: 0`: the classifier diffs two real commits. Flags and exit codes: `harness-only --help`. The rules a wiring must hold: [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) § The rules to hold when wiring it.

## Semantics

- The harness path set: `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.opencode/`, `.cursor/`, `.pi/`, and the root `opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc`. Prefixes match on the separator and the config names match whole, so `.agentsfoo/x`, `opencode.json.bak` and `ui/opencode.json` are product paths.
- `pull_request` diffs from the merge base (`base...head`); `push` and `merge_group` diff the two endpoints (`base head`), because a force-push leaves the `before` sha off the head's history.
- Rename detection is off, so both sides of a `git mv` into a render tree are listed and the diff answers `false`.
- `stdout` carries the verdict line and nothing else; changed paths and reasons go to `stderr`.
- Exit `0` with every verdict; `2` on a wiring error, which prints no verdict.

## Fail-closed

Every unprovable case answers `false`: an unclassified event; a missing, empty or unresolvable endpoint, the all-zero sha of a first push included; a diff git cannot read; an empty changed-file set; a path git had to quote; a manifest the head tree lists but that will not read. No flag turns any of these into a `true`.

## Customise

Nothing to configure. The script is upstream's: `kendex refresh` rewrites the render tree, so a local edit under `.agents/skills/harness-ci/` is drift. Send changes to [vanillagreencom/kendex](https://github.com/vanillagreencom/kendex); maintainer notes are in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).
