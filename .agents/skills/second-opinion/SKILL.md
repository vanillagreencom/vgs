# Second Opinion

> **Problem with this skill?** Run `kendex report` — it files to the owning repo automatically. Do not hand-file.

Cross-model second opinion via external AI CLI. Every mode walks the `SECOND_OPINION_MODELS` roster in priority order and takes the first target that is available and runs a different model — Codex from a Claude Code session, Claude from a Codex session; when nothing eligible remains the run refuses and says why. The full contract — options, target selection and identity rules, environment keys and defaults, review scope and stamping, output clearing and ownership, option syntax, and exit codes — is `second-opinion --help`.

```bash
.agents/skills/second-opinion/scripts/second-opinion <mode> [options]
```

## Workflows

| Command | Workflow | Output |
|---------|----------|--------|
| `review [scope]` | [workflows/review.md](workflows/review.md) | Review finding JSON |
| `challenge [description]` | [workflows/challenge.md](workflows/challenge.md) | Structured critique (text) |
| `audit [path]` | [workflows/audit.md](workflows/audit.md) | Review finding JSON |
| `quick [question]` | [workflows/quick.md](workflows/quick.md) | Text response |
| `detect` | (built-in) | Target name(s) a review would run |

## Execution Rules

- Execute all workflow sections in order. The workflow decides what to skip via "**Skip if**" conditions — never skip based on your own scope assessment.
- `<output_format>` tags are literal templates: fill `[PLACEHOLDERS]`, omit empty lines, add nothing else, do not paraphrase.
- **Pass `--target`** when the user explicitly requests a specific model/CLI (e.g., "use Claude", "ask Codex"). Otherwise omit it — the script selects from the roster and the current session's model. A forced target that runs this session's model is refused; report the refusal, do not work around it.
- **Do not pass `--timeout`** unless the user explicitly asks for a different value for this specific call — the script reads the default from project config.
- **Always pass `--cwd`** with the absolute project root path. Never use `--cwd .`.
- For `quick` mode, you can pass the question as an inline argument instead of writing a file: `second-opinion quick "your question here" --cwd /path`

## Session identity

Cross-model is enforced in every mode: a run with no eligible target exits 1 naming every candidate and its reason, writing nothing and invoking nothing. In a multi-model front end (Pi, OpenCode, Cursor) or an undetected harness, export `SECOND_OPINION_CURRENT_MODEL` in that session's own environment (`none` when there is no session model) — never in a project settings file. Identity resolution, normalization, and the refusal rules: `second-opinion --help`.

## Multi-lane review

`SECOND_OPINION_COUNT` of 2 or more makes `review` run up to that many distinct eligible models in parallel on one pinned scope and write a single union artifact. Lane resolution, merge rules, artifact placement and permissions, scratch durability, and the failure taxonomy: [references/multi-lane.md](references/multi-lane.md).

## Configuration

Set non-sensitive defaults in `kendex.settings.toml` under `[env]`. Existing `.env.local` and `.env` values still work; `.env.local` wins. The one exception is `SECOND_OPINION_CURRENT_MODEL` — export it in the environment of the session that needs it; a value in any project file (`.env`, `kendex.settings.toml`, `.kendex/settings.toml`, `.env.local`) is refused. Project installs seed `kendex.settings.toml` from this skill's `kendex.settings.toml.example` when missing and merge only absent second-opinion keys into existing files. Keys, defaults, and the built-in `claude`/`codex` commands: `second-opinion --help`.

## Error Handling

On script failure, stderr carries a JSON error object (`{"error": "description", "target": "codex"}`) or a plain `Error:` line for pre-flight configuration errors; exit codes, preserved-response paths, and the output-clearing/ownership rules are in `second-opinion --help`. Report the stated reason — an ineligible-target refusal is fixed by installing the CLI or adjusting `SECOND_OPINION_<NAME>_CMD`, `SECOND_OPINION_MODELS`, or `SECOND_OPINION_CURRENT_MODEL`, never by forcing the same model. For a timeout, suggest a larger `--timeout` or a narrower `--range`.

Callers budget review passes **per pushed head** (`qa_metadata.reviewed_head`) — a new head is a new round. Downstream freshness checks (`orch review-artifact-check --file <path> [delegated_at]`) validate filesystem mtime and independently reject self-reported no-review artifacts (reason `no_review`) and qa-shaped artifacts missing their finding arrays (reason `incomplete`), regardless of verdict.

If the script fails during the orch `review-pr` or `submit-pr` (local pre-PR review) workflows, **continue** — external review is advisory.
