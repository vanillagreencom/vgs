# Regression test for the second-opinion CLI-failure gate (kendex#809).
#
# When the external CLI fails to produce ANY review — it exits non-zero
# (quota/auth/network), times out, or returns nothing on a zero exit — the
# wrapper used to exit 0 with no artifact and no sidecar (or a generic exit 1),
# so a caller trusting the documented exit-code contract recorded success with
# no external opinion, invisibly, exactly when the lane was down. The fix routes
# these into the no-verdict class (like the no-scope/no-review gates): review/
# audit modes preserve whatever partial output exists as <output>.failed.json,
# echo the CLI's own error text on stderr, and exit EXIT_CLI_FAILED (5). This
# stays distinct from exit 4 (a model that answered but unusably) and does not
# apply to challenge/quick, which keep the generic exit 1.
#
# Drives the real script with a fake target CLI (no network). The stub is
# named `claude` and placed on PATH so the script's `command -v` validation
# passes; its exit code, stdout, stderr, and an optional sleep (for the timeout
# path) are controlled by env vars, and it records each invocation so the
# no-retry expectation on a hard failure can be asserted.
