# Tests for second-opinion review scope gating.
#
# A review invoked with no usable diff scope could still produce a schema-valid
# `verdict: "pass"` artifact while the external model admitted it reviewed
# nothing (qa_metadata.review_performed=false, reason no_scope_provided). The
# fix is two-sided in this script:
#   1. Scope is derived from the worktree BEFORE invoking the CLI (branch,
#      diff range, diffstat, changed-file list embedded in the prompt); an
#      empty or invalid diff fails with distinct exit 3 and never calls the CLI.
#   2. A response whose qa_metadata self-reports no review is never written to
#      --output: it is preserved as <output>.noreview.json and exits 4.
#
# Drives the real script with a fake target CLI (no network). The stub captures
# the prompt it receives on stdin so scope passthrough can be asserted.

# finds nothing and the declared identity below is what the script uses. It also
# makes these suites independent of where they run: same result under Claude
# Code, under Codex, and in CI.
