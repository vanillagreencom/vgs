# Regression test for multi-lane scratch durability and lane-artifact handling
# (VST-221).
#
# The multi-lane parent kept two things in one `mktemp -d` scratch directory:
# each lane's captured stderr, and a `wrap-<lane>.json` re-wrap of the lane's
# review that the union merge read back at the end. Anything that removed that
# directory mid-run — the reviewed repo's own agent CLI, a sandbox, a tmp
# reaper — made the parent report BOTH healthy lanes as unusable and exit 4
# with no external verdict, even though both lane artifacts sat intact and
# valid beside the union path. Without --output the lane artifacts lived in
# that same directory, so clearing it dropped a lane's real findings and the
# union still published a pass.
#
# Contract pinned here:
#   * The parent creates exactly one directory under TMPDIR and everything in
#     it is disposable — losing it costs the stderr replay and nothing else, in
#     BOTH --output and stdout mode. Each lane's review is held in memory from
#     the moment that lane is reaped.
#   * That replay actually reaches the operator: a healthy lane's log and a
#     failing lane's own cause text both arrive on the parent's stderr, lane-
#     prefixed. This is the only channel by which an operator diagnoses exit 5.
#   * An artifact is usable only if it holds exactly one JSON object shaped the
#     way the union merge consumes it. No JSON value at all (jq exits 0 and
#     prints nothing), a truncated stream, or a finding that is not an object
#     are all that lane answering unusably — never a healthy lane contributing
#     nothing, and never an aborted merge that drops the other lane's review.
#   * A lane that exits 0 without a usable artifact is reported with a truthful
#     lane-failure code, never a bare "exit 0" — and that class must not flip
#     the all-lanes-failed aggregate from 5 (nobody answered) to 4 (somebody
#     answered unusably).
#   * Temp space is left clean and owner-only: lane children run under a
#     restrictive umask, and the parent removes every artifact and sidecar it
#     caused to be written there — without letting that cleanup change the
#     run's exit status.
#
# Drives a hermetic copy of the skill (kendex#580) with fake lane CLIs.
