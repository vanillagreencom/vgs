# Tests for second-opinion target selection and multi-lane review.

# Cross-model is the guarantee: every mode walks the SECOND_OPINION_MODELS
# roster in priority order, never dispatches to the model this session runs
# (declared identity — SECOND_OPINION_CURRENT_MODEL / SECOND_OPINION_<NAME>_MODEL),
# and refuses when nothing eligible remains. Breadth is opt-in: with
# SECOND_OPINION_COUNT >= 2 the selected lanes run on the same derived scope
# and write one union artifact:
#   - findings deduplicated by normalized location (file + symbol), duplicate
#     findings carry every contributing lane in `sources`;
#   - a suggestion whose location a blocker already covers is dropped;
#   - lane artifacts kept beside the union as <output>.<target>.json;
#   - one failed lane degrades coverage LOUDLY (qa_metadata.coverage,
#     qa_metadata.lanes) instead of failing the run or narrowing silently;
#   - all lanes failed -> no artifact, exit 4/5 (no-verdict class);
#   - SECOND_OPINION_TARGET / --target still force the single-lane path, but
#     never past the self-exclusion guard;
#   - another target is a settings entry (SECOND_OPINION_<NAME>_CMD), not code.
#
# Drives a hermetic copy of the skill with fake lane CLIs.

# --- Harness-free environment for the identity scenarios ---------------------
# A positively detected single-model harness now beats any contradicting
# declaration, whatever its source, so a scenario cannot simulate an
# arbitrary session by exporting an identity while a real harness is visible —
# it has to genuinely not have one. Detection reads the process tree first and
# the environment markers second, so both are neutralized: a `ps` stand-in that
# reports init as the first parent, and the markers unset.
#
# This file ALSO has scenarios that need real detection (run_under, run_s33 and
# the detached runs), so the stub is NOT on the global PATH — it is applied per
# invocation through $PS_FREE_PATH by the runners that declare identities.
