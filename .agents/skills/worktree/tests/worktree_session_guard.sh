# Regression tests for the worktree session guard, which exists because cleanup
# passes were destroying live issue worktrees out from under working sessions.
#
# Every case runs against throwaway repositories under a temporary directory:
# no repository worktree is claimed, locked, or removed by this suite.
#
# The central regression is the one that motivated the guard: a worktree in
# active use must survive a concurrent cleanup pass, with its registration, its
# branch, and its uncommitted edits intact. The rest of the suite covers the
# ways a guard can fail open — an unevaluable TTL, a sweep that reads a lease
# before taking the mutex, a lease left unreleasable after its directory is
# destroyed, and a lock state the status output cannot distinguish.
