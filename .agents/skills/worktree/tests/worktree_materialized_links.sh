# #856: a rebase replaces a configured symlink with a real directory holding
# only the tracked files underneath, dropping every kendex-installed path there.
# git sees nothing (the surviving files are the tracked ones), so the damage
# surfaces much later as scripts failing exit 127 on files they used to source.
#
# Two detections are asserted here:
#   1. the support-library guard, which is where the live incident actually
#      presented — a bare 127 naming neither cause nor recovery;
#   2. the use-time check on `push`, the usual first command after a MANUAL
#      rebase (the case the script never sees and therefore never repairs).
#
# Both messages must send the operator to the MAIN CHECKOUT: in the observed
# incident the worktree's own copy of the script was among the missing files.
