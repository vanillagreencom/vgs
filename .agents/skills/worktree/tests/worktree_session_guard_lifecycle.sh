# Lifecycle integration between `worktree` and `worktree-session-guard` (#877).
#
# The shape under test is Option C from the issue: claiming is NOT automatic —
# `create` never takes a lease — while the DESTRUCTIVE operations all respect
# one. That split is the whole design:
#
#   * If `create` claimed, every worktree would stay claimed for life (nothing
#     but an explicit `remove` releases), so a lease-aware `cleanup` would stop
#     collecting merged worktrees entirely unless `--stale` were passed. The
#     alternative — releasing on a provably merged branch — guts the guarantee,
#     because uncommitted work in a merged tree is exactly what gets lost.
#   * The destructive side is where the incident actually was, so that is what
#     is wired: `cleanup` never collects a claimed tree, `remove` releases only
#     its OWN lease, `create --reuse` refuses a foreign one and refreshes its
#     own.
#
# The `worktree` script's own per-issue claim lock requires flock(1) (`create`
# refuses to run without it), so this integration suite can only run where
# flock exists. The guard itself does not: its mutation mutex falls back to a
# mkdir mutex on hosts with no flock, reached here by running the guard on a
# PATH built without flock.
