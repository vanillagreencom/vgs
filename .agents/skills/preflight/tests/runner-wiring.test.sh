# runner files a world commits, the literal invocation text each carries, and
# the suites the change then adds; the verdict pins whether that text put the
# runner at a command position. A wired suite is exit 0 with the clean
# verdict line and its exact changed-file count, so a world that quietly
# writes a file more or fewer than the row names cannot pass; an unwired one
# is exit 1 with the whole fired set, so a row that wires one suite and
# strands another proves both at once.

# `read -d ''` rather than `$(cat <<'ROWS' ...)`: Bash 3.2 scans a here-document
# inside a command substitution for quotes, and a row carrying an odd number of
# double quotes runs its parse past the closing parenthesis. It returns 1 at
# the end of the document, which errexit must not read; an empty table is
# pf_table's refusal.
#
# The two `manifestdir` rows and the two `vitestdefault` rows differ by one
# added suite, and `norunner`'s three by one added runner: each state is its
# own world, and the fired set of the later state carries the claim that the
# earlier state's suites stayed wired. `validatescope` is the same shape --
# `far.test.ts` is the whole fired set, so `sub/app.test.ts` is wired by the
# same row.
#
# The `make` world is the one runner kind here with no `fires` twin, and the
# gap that leaves is deliberate. Its row is clean, so dropping `Makefile` from
# the tool's runner name set empties the runner set, the lane goes silent for
# want of evidence rather than because the suite is wired, and the row stays
# green. Closing it means a second `make` world carrying a shell suite the
# vitest default include cannot reach, which is coverage this audit round did
# not add.
