# The Linear-loop janitor template (docs/linear-loops.md, catalog repo only)

# bundle parent ships as one PR, is born outside Triage, carries its
# project's full label set, and takes its children's highest priority —
# backlog ordering reads the parent, not the children. These are markdown
# contracts, so this test statically pins them; it passes vacuously where
# the template is not shipped.
