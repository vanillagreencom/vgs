# does load it, reads the answer here rather than restating the default.
#
# The load runs in a subshell. The same [env] table carries keys such as
# ORCH_STATE_DIR that decide where these scripts read and write their state,
# and resolving a measurement setting must not move that; only this one value
# comes back out. A table this project cannot parse fails the measurement
# rather than falling back to the default, which would score the branch under
# roots the project did not choose.
#
# The one value leaves on descriptor 3, with the subshell's stdout pointed at
# stderr for the duration of the load. The private env file is SOURCED, so
# anything it prints would otherwise land in the capture ahead of the value: a
# stray token naming a real top-level directory becomes a render root, changed
# code under it pairs off as a mirror, and the branch measures smaller than it
# is — the one direction that lets an oversized branch past the tripwire.

BRANCH_SIZE_BASELINE=""
# Split the branch's added lines into production, test, and mandated render
# mirror lines. Additions alone are counted there, so a rewrite that moves
# lines earns no headroom from what it deleted. Test lines are counted apart
# because they answer to their own allowance, and a total that folds the two
# hides which one grew.
#
# The render-mirror roots come from branch_growth_render_roots, not from an
# argument: every caller of this measurement resolves one list, once. A render
# is counted once, at the source it renders, and the pairing is by path: strip
# a changed path's leading render-root segment and it is a mirror only when what remains
# names a source changed in the same diff — equal to that source's path without
# its final extension, or ending in it at a segment boundary when the source
# path has a directory of its own. The equal form covers a render whose
# extension differs from its source (a markdown agent rendered as a Codex
# toml); the suffix form covers a nested render root (a hook rendered under
# the Pi kendex directory). A root-level source takes only the equal form: by
# basename alone a root README would pair with every README under every
# render root. A render whose own source did not
# change pairs with nothing and is measured in full, and so is a render-only
# branch.
#
# $4 is the blank-separated list of extra test-path globs a repository adds to
# the built-in test rule. A pattern matches the whole repository-relative path,
# with `*` any run of characters including `/`, `?` any single character, and
# everything else literal. The list only adds: empty, or matching nothing, it
# leaves every line where the built-in rule put it, which for a path that rule
# does not name is production and the stricter allowance.
#
# The globs reach awk through the environment, not a `-v` assignment: awk
# processes escape sequences in a `-v` value before the program sees it, so a
# backslash in a configured glob would be rewritten, and rewritten differently
# by gawk and mawk. An ENVIRON entry arrives byte for byte.
