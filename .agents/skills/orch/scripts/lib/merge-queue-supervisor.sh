# Detached supervisor for one merge-queue launch attempt. The named failure
# it prevents: queue-wait dying without output (crash, signal, logout) or
# wedging on a hung GitHub read past its own budget would leave a watch
# nothing is running and a consume that could only time out. The supervisor
# publishes an `unknown` artifact when its worker exits unreadably and reaps
# a worker that outlives the deadline, so every launch attempt ends in a
# consumable artifact — and only while its own generation is still the
# registered one, so a dead attempt can never publish over its replacement.
#
# One exit publishes nothing: a supervisor whose launch home has been deleted
# under it has nothing left to publish into, so the attempt ends unpublished
# and consume terminalizes it as watch_lost.
