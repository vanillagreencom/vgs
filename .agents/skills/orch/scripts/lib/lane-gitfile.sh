# resolves the clone from it, and a hosted launch writes its lane marker under

# ../../workflows/merge-pr.md § 5 leaves behind a merged lane until lane-close
# runs; 2 the read failed, ERRF saying why; 3 the file names no linked
# worktree, LANE_HOSTED_GITLINE holding the line it read, empty for an empty
# file. A root that is itself a clone has a `.git` directory, which `cat`
# fails on and whose HEAD answers: the clone is the root, with no `.git`
# appended, and ERRF keeps the `.git` read's own words where HEAD does not
# answer either.
