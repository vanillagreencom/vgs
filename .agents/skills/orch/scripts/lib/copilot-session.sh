# The Copilot CLI session record: the one writer and reader of the JSON the CLI
# hands its `statusLine` command on stdin, for every reader that wants a live
# context figure for a Copilot session.
#
# Copilot keeps no live context count anywhere a reader can open: its
# `events.jsonl` transcript carries usage only in the event a session writes as
# it ends, and the pane footer is a display. The status line command is the one
# live producer. `copilot-statusline`, the script beside this library's
# directory, is that command: it persists the JSON it received as a record bound
# to the session, and lib/adapters/copilot.sh reads it back for the shared
# context judge. Nothing here parses a pane or a screen.
#
# One record per session, at `<COPILOT_HOME>/lane-status/<session_id>.json`,
# under the account directory the session runs on. The record carries the CLI's
# own object under `status`, exactly as received, and beside it what binds it:
#
#   session_id       the CLI's, repeated at the top for the reader's match
#   transcript_path  the CLI's, so a hook payload naming a transcript is held
#                    to the record and never to a guess
#   copilot_home     the account directory the command ran under
#   written_at       epoch seconds, for the freshness rule below
#
# A reader answers with a record only where every binding it holds agrees: the
# session id it was handed, the account directory, the transcript path where it
# has one, and a record no older than COPILOT_SESSION_MAX_AGE_S, an age equal to
# the bound still fresh. Anything else is unmeasured under a reason the reader
# names, never a figure: a record from another session, or one the CLI stopped
# refreshing, would read as a session with room for as long as it stood.
#
# Sourced, never run. Bash 3.2-safe, like its callers.
