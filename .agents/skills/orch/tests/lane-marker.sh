# lane-marker: the one writer of a lane's launch record, both halves of it —
# the marker under the common git directory that lane-mail-check reads to know
# a session is a launched lane, and the lane's own tmp/lane-mail/<ITEM>, which
# that hook resolves the item by.
#
# Every case builds a worktree under TMP_ROOT, runs the real script against it
# and asserts its exit status, the keyed first line of stderr, and what stands
# on disk after. The containment rows matter most: this script is where the two
# launchers' hand-rolled copies of that rule were folded, and lane-mail is the
# owner it now agrees with — from tmp/lane-mail down, with tmp itself left
# alone because a worktree setup may link it.
