# Regression lint for kendex#968. audit-issues.md is a user-facing wrapper with
# an interactive § 6 approval gate, but the orch call sites said "run the
# workflow" without saying WHERE, and orchestrators delegated the whole wrapper
# to a tpm subagent. A subagent runner structurally skips the gate: it cannot
# present the § 6 multi-select, and one observed run (CC-935) executed § 7 —
# creating 5 issues and 6 relations — on a scope-reaffirming follow-up message,
# before the primary session obtained user approval.
#
# The fix declares the wrapper primary-session-only, names the tpm-audit.md
# analysis as the ONLY delegable part at the orch call sites, and makes § 6
# fail closed (with a § 7 hard precondition) for runners without interactive
# question capability. This lint pins each statement.
