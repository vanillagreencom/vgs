# Regression tests for orch/scripts/approval-wait (kendex#538, kendex#642).
#
# approval-wait is the GitHub-native reviewer-gate poller that replaced
# bot-review-wait: it reads ONLY formal review verdicts
# (`gh pr view --json reviewDecision,latestReviews`, and in --mode review the
# REST pulls/reviews listing pinned to the current head) plus the unresolved
# review-thread count — never emoji reactions, sticky comments, or checklist
# prose. Covers:
#   1. reviewDecision APPROVED               -> approved, exit 0
#   2. empty reviewDecision + latest APPROVED -> approved via fallback, exit 0
#   3. latest CHANGES_REQUESTED               -> changes_requested, exit 1
#   4. COMMENTED-only latest reviews          -> no verdict, timeout, exit 1
#   5. unresolved threads, no verdict         -> comments early return, exit 1
#   6. nothing at all at the deadline         -> timeout, exit 1
#   7. REVIEW_REQUIRED + latest APPROVED      -> NOT approved (protection wants
#                                                more), timeout
#   8. APPROVED with unresolved threads       -> approved, unresolved_count
#                                                reported for the caller's gate
#   9. verdict arriving on a later poll       -> approved after polling
#  10. auth failure with --json               -> parseable error object, exit 3
#  11. text mode always prints a result line; approval-mode lines for
#      changes-requested, comments, and error pinned verbatim (kendex#649)
#  12. review mode: COMMENTED at head, 0 threads -> reviewed, exit 0
#  13. review mode: review at head + threads     -> comments early return
#  14. review mode: review at stale commit only  -> timeout (head pinning)
#  15. review mode: PR author's own review only  -> timeout (author excluded)
#  16. review mode: DISMISSED review only        -> timeout (dismissal excluded)
#  17. review mode: standing CHANGES_REQUESTED   -> changes_requested, exit 1
#  18. review mode: CHANGES_REQUESTED superseded by COMMENTED -> reviewed
#  19. review mode: APPROVED counts as a review  -> reviewed, exit 0
#  20. review mode: review arriving on a later poll -> reviewed after polling
#  21. review mode text output names the review gate for reviewed,
#      changes-requested, comments, timeout, and error — never "Approval"
#      (kendex#649)
#  check1-8: PR_REVIEW_CHECK check-run evidence (kendex#654) — a "success"
#      conclusion of the configured check name on the CURRENT head opens the
#      review gate (newest run of that name wins; review_evidence "check",
#      review_evidence_surface "check_run"); stale-sha and failure
#      conclusions do not; unresolved threads and a standing
#      CHANGES_REQUESTED still block; empty PR_REVIEW_CHECK ignores
#      check-runs entirely; the review-object path still works with the
#      feature on (review_evidence "review"); text mode names the check-run
#      and its app slug
#  status1-8: PR_REVIEW_CHECK commit-status evidence (kendex#681) — with no
#      matching check-run, a "success" commit status with the configured
#      context on the CURRENT head opens the gate (newest of the context
#      wins; review_evidence "check", review_evidence_surface "status"); a
#      matching check-run wins first and skips the status query entirely;
#      pending/failure/error states are not evidence; stale-sha statuses
#      never count; empty PR_REVIEW_CHECK ignores both surfaces; a review
#      object still takes precedence (no surface field); unresolved threads
#      still block; text mode names the status context and its creator
#  22+ --resolve-mode precedence: PR_REVIEW_GATE beats legacy PR_APPROVAL_GATE
#      (on -> approval, off -> off), default approval, settings-file source,
#      invalid value falls back to approval
#  nudge1-5: PR_REVIEW_NUDGE/PR_REVIEW_NUDGE_SECS — once per head, clock reset
#      on head change, empty-body fallback to reviewer re-request (or silence
#      with nobody to re-request), approval-mode parity
#  transient1-4: transient GitHub API failures (kendex#748) — an HTTP 503
#      from the reviews listing (or approval-mode pr view) is absorbed with
#      backoff inside the wait budget and reported as transient_api_errors
#      on the eventual success; a persistent 503 becomes terminal only when
#      the budget expires, preserving the original error message plus the
#      count; an HTTP 404 stays immediately terminal with no count
#   proceed1-13: PR_REVIEW_ON_TIMEOUT reviewer-down flexibility — a deadline
#      reached with zero unresolved threads AND no reviewer evidence AND an
#      unchanged head degrades to "proceeded" (exit 0) under "proceed" (review
#      and approval modes; also via the --on-timeout flag), while open threads
#      still return "comments", a standing CHANGES_REQUESTED still blocks, an
#      active COMMENTED review in approval mode still times out (not silence), a
#      head change during the wait falls back to timeout (no fair window on the
#      new commit), a present-but-not-success trusted check/status (failed or
#      pending) in review mode still times out (engagement, not silence), a head
#      that moved in the final last-poll->emit confirm window falls back to
#      timeout (no proceed on a superseded head), the
#      default is "block" (timeout), and an unrecognized value falls back to
#      block with a warning
#   marker1: a proceed posts NO commit status and emits no outage_marker JSON
#      field — the reviewer-outage attestation was removed (owner decision
#      2026-08-08: orch never manufactures review evidence); the legacy
#      PR_REVIEW_OUTAGE_CONTEXT key is exported in the test to prove it is
#      inert
# Same always-emit-JSON discipline and exit-code contract as ci-wait.

# Parametrized `gh` stub (same auth model as the ci_wait stub).
#   STUB_APPROVAL_MODE selects the canned `pr view --json
#   reviewDecision,latestReviews` payload; STUB_THREADS_UNRESOLVED sets the
#   unresolved count returned by the `api graphql` reviewThreads query.
#   STUB_APPROVAL_COUNT_FILE turns *_later modes into poll-count-driven
#   sequences (first poll pending, second poll terminal).
#   Review mode: `pr view --json headRefOid,author` reports head "headsha1"
#   and author "pr-author" (STUB_HEAD_MODE=changes flips to "headsha2" after
#   two calls via STUB_HEAD_COUNT_FILE); STUB_REVIEWS_MODE selects the canned
#   REST pulls/reviews payload, with STUB_REVIEWS_COUNT_FILE driving the
#   reviewed_later poll sequence.
#   Nudges: `pr comment` bodies and requested_reviewers POSTs append to
#   STUB_NUDGE_LOG so tests can count them; STUB_REVIEW_REQUESTS=some makes
#   `pr view --json reviewRequests` report one requested reviewer.
#   Check-runs: `api repos/*/commits/<sha>/check-runs` answers per the sha in
#   the URL — STUB_CHECKS_MODE=success_at_head/failure_at_head publishes a
#   "Review Bot" run (older failure + newer terminal run, plus an unrelated
#   "Other Check") on headsha1 only; success_stale publishes it on oldsha
#   only, so the current-head query finds nothing.
#   Commit statuses: `api repos/*/commits/<sha>/status` (combined status)
#   answers likewise — STUB_STATUS_MODE=success_at_head/pending_at_head/
#   failure_at_head/error_at_head publishes a "Review Bot" context (older
#   pending entry + newer terminal status, plus an unrelated "Other Status")
#   on headsha1 only; success_stale publishes it on oldsha only. Each status
#   query appends to STUB_STATUS_LOG (when set) so tests can assert the
#   fallback is skipped once a check-run matches.
