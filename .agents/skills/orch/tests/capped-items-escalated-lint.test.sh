# Regression lint for KEN-518. When review-pr § 4 hit the cycle cap, the
# verification pass's outstanding blockers routed to § 5 without ever landing
# in `fixed_items` or `escalated_items`. § 8's decline derivation ("in a
# json_paths artifact but in neither bucket → declined") then reported live
# blockers as declined with `reason: not recorded` and dropped them from the
# filing candidates — nothing filed them.
#
# What this pins are IDENTIFIERS and their relationships, never sentences:
# review-bots.md bans sentence-pinning lints on markdown, and an editorial
# rephrase must not fail a suite while the contract holds. The contract is
# carried by tokens that cannot be reworded without changing behaviour —
# `escalated_items`, `fixed_items`, `outcome`/`blocked`, `--slurpfile`,
# `qa-review`, the `At The Cap` heading — plus the relationships between them:
# one command carries the drop and the record, the cap section precedes Fix
# Delegation, and every token sits inside the section that owns it.
