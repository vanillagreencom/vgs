# Regression tests for worktree-claim: the delegation-side possession gate over
# the worktree skill's session guard. Two sessions working the same issue share
# one lease owner, so the owner match alone cannot refuse a sibling writer; the
# per-claim generation token can. worktree-claim binds a caller to the token it
# claimed under and fails closed (exit 75) when any other holder — a different
# issue's lease, a foreign lock, a sibling's re-claim, or a lease released
# underneath an expectation — would make the caller a second writer.
