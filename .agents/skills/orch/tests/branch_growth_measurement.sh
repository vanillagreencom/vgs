# past the tripwire. The file is written after the commit, so it is untracked
# and adds no lines of its own to either branch.
#
# The row reads the two judges that resolve the roots inside this measurement.
# branch-size-check loads the project environment in its own shell and has
# always emitted whatever the env file prints ahead of its JSON, on main as
# here, so it answers to its own fix and not to this one.
