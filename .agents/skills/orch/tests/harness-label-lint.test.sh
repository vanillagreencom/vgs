# Regression lint for kendex#818 (harness-specific claims stated as universal).
#
# The orch/dev skills run on Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi, and they
# already carry a labeling pattern for per-harness behavior: the
# `> If you are running in **Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode / Pi**:` blocks in
# orch SKILL.md, and inline-labeled bullets like `**Task-based** (Claude Code)`.
# kendex#818's audit found harness-specific instructions sitting OUTSIDE that
# pattern — an `AskUserQuestion` reference in a universal section, `Explore`
# sub-agents named in the every-harness bootstrap, a `sleep`-poll loop the
# skill's own Codex block says the `approval=never` classifier rejects, and the
# Claude-Code Bash-tool `~10 min` cap presented as a property of every harness.
#
# This lint asserts: every line in the orch/dev docs that carries a known
# harness-specific TOKEN must be harness-LABELED. A token line is labeled when a
# harness name appears anywhere in its block context:
#   - the token line itself, or
#   - the contiguous non-blank run (paragraph / blockquote / list item) it
#     belongs to, or
#   - for a token inside a fenced code block: the fence plus the paragraph that
#     introduces it (blank lines between prose and fence are skipped), or
#   - the nearest preceding Markdown heading.
#
# That is deliberately permissive about WHERE the label sits (inline, blockquote
# lead-in, or section heading all count) and strict only about it existing, so
# ordinary edits near a labeled block do not trip it. It does not check that the
# label names the *owning* harness — a Codex block may legitimately say "there
# is no ~10-min tool cap".
