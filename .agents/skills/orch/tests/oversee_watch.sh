# Regression tests for the GitHub side of orch/scripts/oversee-watch, and for
# the failures that take the whole process down. The pane side — window-gone,
# lane-exited, usage-limit, question, idle-after-return — is
# oversee_watch_lanes.sh; both build their sandbox from
# lib/oversee-watch-harness.sh.
#
# oversee-watch is the overseer's single blocking watch: it loops until the
# fleet needs a hand and prints ONE `EVENT <kind> ...` line. Covered here:
#   1.  pr-watch: on the fleet's first run attention present at start is a
#       baseline (no event, one stderr note, context on the next event); that
#       baseline persists, so a line appearing between two runs is the next
#       run's first-pass event and a standing line is not; a NEW `<pr> <kind>`
#       line mid-run is the event; a head-only change is not; GH_REPO reaches
#       pr-watch; rc≠0 with no lines is a global failure (exit 2); attention
#       at start does not starve a lane's question; the state file is
#       rewritten after every pass, and an uncreatable state dir or an
#       unreadable state file exits 2 naming the path
#   2.  merged: an --item's PR merged at/after --since fires; a PR merged
#       BEFORE --since, a non-item branch, and a non-item conventional branch
#       do not; a fork's PR on the same head branch name does not; item ids
#       match branches case-insensitively; no --since means no floor; no
#       --item skips the check with a note; gh stderr noise on success does
#       not break the JSON parse
#   5.  heartbeat after --max-loops with the open PR list
#   6.  gh auth failure exits 2; a stale env token falls through to the
#       project GH_BOT_TOKEN; a failing pr list exits 2 (never a quiet 0)
#   7.  lanes given outside tmux exit 2
#   8.  a missing pr-watch.sh is a stderr note, not a failure
#   9.  --help exits 0, names the probe it runs, and states both liveness
#       rules including the unusable-probe path
