# Regression tests for the one thing that authorizes a fix round: the round
# record dev-round-write stamps at delegation time. dev-artifact-check reads it
# for both the delegated item set and the protected additions the round may
# make, so anything that lets a check run WITHOUT that record, or lets a record
# reach the additions probe carrying a base_sha or an adds path the reader's
# own rules forbid, is a bypass of the whole gate rather than one weak
# assertion.
#
# Each case here pairs a control that must pass with a mutation of exactly one
# input that must refuse, so a refusal cannot be credited to the wrong arm.
