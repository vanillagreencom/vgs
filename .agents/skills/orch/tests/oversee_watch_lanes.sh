# Regression tests for the pane side of orch/scripts/oversee-watch: what the
# watch reads off a lane's tmux window. The GitHub side — pr-watch, merged,
# the heartbeat and the process-wide failures — is oversee_watch.sh; both
# build their sandbox from lib/oversee-watch-harness.sh.
#
# Covered here:
#   3.  a listed lane window that no longer exists
#   3b. a live window whose pane holds a bare shell with no child process on
#       two consecutive passes — the harness exited (pane tail follows); one
#       pass alone, and a shell followed by a live command, are not events; a
#       login shell (-bash) counts; a shell WITH a child is a live lane (the
#       wrapper typed at a prompt) and costs one ps per pass; a live pane
#       command is not an event and never reaches ps; an unreadable pane
#       command is window-gone
#   3c. usage-limit: a limit banner under a still-running harness fires on
#       one pass, for either harness's wording, under a wrapped shell, ahead
#       of a question on the same screen, and names the config dir a live
#       lane claim maps the window to; a pruned claim names none; a healthy
#       pane never fires; a banner under an exited harness is lane-exited
#       instead; and a banner above a later user turn is scrollback, while
#       one below that turn still fires. Codex's benign reset OFFER is not a
#       spent account
#   4.  a lane pane showing a question prompt (pane tail follows), under a
#       wrapped shell too, and on either harness's dialog screen; a selection
#       list above the last user turn is one the lane already answered and
#       never fires, while one below that turn still does
#   4b. idle-after-return: a harness at its composer with nothing in flight
#       on two consecutive passes (either harness's prompt, and under a
#       wrapped shell); one pass alone, a working indicator alongside the
#       prompt, and an idle pass followed by a working one are not events; a
#       working indicator above the last user turn is scrollback and still
#       fires, while one below that turn does not, and a user turn's marker
#       above that boundary is not the composer the lane sits at
