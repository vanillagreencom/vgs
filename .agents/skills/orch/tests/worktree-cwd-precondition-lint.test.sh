# Regression lint for KEN-878. A delegated agent's shell does not reliably
# start in the worktree it was delegated: two lanes each ran bare-relative
# commands — `tools/guard` among them — against another lane's worktree,
# and both noticed only after a confusing downstream failure.
#
# The cure is a precondition the agent runs before anything repo-relative,
# and it HALTS: a tool like `tools/guard` re-derives the repo from the
# process cwd, so no path spelling makes a wrong-tree shell safe and there
# is no remedy for the check to get right. This lint holds the precondition
# as ONE canonical sentence rather than as a set of shape rules. Every
# shipped check line is byte-identical apart from the block's own
# placeholder token, so the test carries that sentence in $CANON with
# `@TOKEN@` where the token goes, and each site must equal it with its own
# token substituted in. Equality is the whole predicate:
# nothing infers "opens with a command", "mentions pwd", or "names the
# token", so no prose mutation can satisfy the letter of a heuristic while
# leaving the agent with nothing to run. A future wording change is made in
# $CANON and at every site together, or the lint reds.
#
# Both sides of the comparison are physical paths. The fill line derives
# the delegated path with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, so the check
# runs `pwd -P`: a bare `pwd` prints the logical path and would halt a
# correct delegate whose shell entered the checkout through a symlink.
#
# Six rules are enforced:
#
#   1. A `Worktree: [TOKEN]` line is followed on the very next line by the
#      canonical `Worktree Check:` line for that same TOKEN.
#   2. EVERY block carries that pair. No path matcher decides which
#      delegations need it: judging "does this delegate touch the repo"
#      from the block's literal text missed blocks with no pair at all,
#      then missed blocks whose paths are placeholders the caller fills.
#      The pair costs two lines on a delegation that never touches the
#      repo, and uniform is the only rule that cannot be wrong.
#   3. EVERY block is preceded by the canonical fill line, held in
#      $CANON_FILL by the same equality predicate. The pair is worth
#      nothing if the value poured into it is not what `pwd -P` prints, and
#      the workflows resolved that value to `.` or to "the current
#      directory", so a filled delegation halted in a CORRECT checkout. The
#      fill line names plain `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, whose output
#      is absolute and physical, so both sides of the comparison agree by
#      construction. Plain, not an orch wrapper around it: the fill line
#      also ships in project-management, which declares `git` and not orch,
#      so a wrapper would not exist in an install carrying one skill and
#      not the other — the placeholder would come out empty and the
#      precondition would vanish with it. Per block, because a doc
#      satisfying the rule once bought silence for every later block: the
#      second block in audit-issues.md carried its own resolution, to an
#      absolute LOGICAL path, and a file-wide assertion never read it.
#   4. No line among those rule 3 reads opens with the fill line's opening
#      clause and then diverges from it. A second instruction addressing
#      the same two fields does not clear `hasfill`, so the canonical line
#      plus a contradicting one read as clean. The rule is the DECIDABLE
#      half of that: same opening clause, not byte-equal. It is not a
#      conflict detector — prose that contradicts the fill line in its own
#      words is not caught, and deciding that it does would be semantic
#      judgment, which this repo has twice ruled out of a lexical scanner.
#      Do not widen it; write a conflicting instruction in the canonical
#      shape or leave the boundary where it is.
#
#   5. Exactly one `Worktree:` line and one `Worktree Check:` line per
#      block, and every check line sits directly under a `Worktree:` line.
#      Rule 1 read the line after a `Worktree:` line and recorded a
#      boolean, so a block could carry the canonical pair and then append
#      `Worktree Check: on mismatch continue`, leaving the delegate two
#      checks with no ordering between them and the suite green; a
#      duplicated pair passed for the same reason. The rule counts, it
#      does not read: a second check line is reported for existing, not
#      for what it says. A check line whose preceding line is not a
#      `Worktree:` line is an orphan and is reported at its own line.
#
#   6. A file carrying the canonical fill line names `[DIR]` on some other
#      line. The fill line introduces `[DIR]` and never says what it is,
#      and three workflows shipped it with the token bound nowhere: the
#      caller had nothing to substitute, so the placeholder came out empty
#      and the delegation dropped both lines. Only the DECIDABLE half is
#      asserted. Each workflow resolves the path its own way, so there is
#      no canonical binding sentence to compare against, and the predicate
#      is that the token appears somewhere else in the file. Whether that
#      mention BINDS the token is semantic judgment, which this repo has
#      ruled out of a lexical scanner, so prose merely naming `[DIR]`
#      clears the rule. What it catches is the shipped defect: a token
#      introduced once and defined nowhere.
#
#      Rules 1, 2 and 5 read inside a `<delegation_format>` block; rules 3
#      and 4 read the lines between one block and the block before it;
#      rule 6 reads the whole file.
#
# A block ends at three terminators, not one: its closing tag, a new opening
# tag arriving while it is still open, and end of file. All three route
# through one `close_block`, so no rule is reachable only through a
# well-formed block — deleting a closing tag along with the pair used to
# leave the delegation unscanned and the suite green. An unterminated block
# is itself reported, naming the opener's line, so a reader sees that the
# document is malformed and not only that a pair is missing.
#
# Scope is every skill doc that can carry a delegation, in BOTH trees where
# both exist: the `skills/` source and the `.agents/skills/` render agents
# actually load. Deriving the scan root from this file's own location would
# leave each copy scanning only its own half, and CI runs the source copy
# alone, so the render would ship unguarded with the suite green. An
# INSTALLED layout has no `skills/` at all (the CLI integration check runs
# this suite from `.agents/skills/orch/tests/`); there the lint scans the
# one tree it has and names that mode in its output, so no reader mistakes
# an installed run for a full one. A `skills/` tree whose render is missing
# is a defect, not an installed layout, and stays red. Tests are excluded:
# their probe fixtures carry deliberately broken blocks. A `Worktree:`
# mention in prose or in a fenced example is not a delegation and is not
# scanned.

# scan_worktree_fill <file>
# Emits one defect line per delegation block the canonical fill line does not
# precede. The scope is the BLOCK, not the file: a doc that states the
# canonical resolution once and a divergent one before a later block passed a
# file-wide assertion, and the later block is the one that poured a logical
# path into a `pwd -P` comparison. So the demand is raised at every opening
# tag and the evidence is cleared at every terminator — each block is asked
# for the sentence again, in the lines between it and the block before it.
# Equality against $CANON_FILL is the whole predicate, so a resolution
# reworded back to `.` or to the current directory reds.
#
# The clearing routes through one `close_block` for the same reason as the
# scanner above: clearing at the closing tag alone let an unterminated block
# carry its evidence forward, and the next block passed on a fill line it is
# not preceded by. The function is a no-op outside a block, so a closed
# block's successor keeps the lines read since. Malformed structure is
# reported once, by scan_worktree_precondition.
#
# Rule 4 rides the same lines. `hasfill` is a latch — it is set and never
# unset — so the canonical line followed by a divergent one still opens the
# next block clean, and the delegating agent reads two instructions with no
# ordering between them. A line opening with $CANON_FILL_OPEN and not equal
# to $CANON_FILL is reported at its own line, whether or not the canonical
# line also appears: same clause, different bytes, nothing semantic. Prose
# contradicting the fill line in its own words is out of scope and stays
# silent; see rule 4 in the header for why that boundary is where it is.
