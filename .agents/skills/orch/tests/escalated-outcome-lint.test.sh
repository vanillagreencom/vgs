# Regression lint for kendex#970. The `escalated_items` workflow-state bucket
# used to conflate two dev outcomes — items dev was BLOCKED on and items dev
# deliberately SKIPPED — distinguishable only via free-text `reason`. Downstream,
# review-pr § 9 fed the bucket wholesale into audit input as `origin:
# "escalated"` ("blockers dev couldn't fix"), so under
# ORCH_DECISION_MODE=auto-recommended skipped low-priority residue was filed as
# if it were unfixable blockers.
#
# The fix threads the dev round's typed per-item decision through the
# state-write boundary as an `outcome` field ("blocked"|"skipped") and maps it
# to distinct audit origins (blocked/absent → "escalated", skipped →
# "skipped"). This lint pins each link of that chain in the instruction docs.
