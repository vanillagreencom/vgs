# The `escalated_items` bucket used to conflate two dev outcomes — items dev
# was BLOCKED on and items dev deliberately SKIPPED — distinguishable only via
# free-text `reason`. review-pr fed the bucket wholesale into audit input as
# `origin: "escalated"` ("blockers dev couldn't fix"), so under
# ORCH_DECISION_MODE=auto-recommended skipped low-priority residue was filed as
# if it were unfixable blockers.
#
# The fix threads the dev round's typed per-item decision through the
# state-write boundary as an `outcome` field and maps it to distinct audit
# origins. Pinned here: the field, the write that carries it, the route from
# each builder to the schema, and in the schema one row per outcome binding it
# to its origin — a relation needs a pin spanning both halves, since two
# independent token greps stay green with the mapping inverted.
#
# NOT pinned in review-pr.md or review.md: the mapping itself. Contiguity was
# not enough — a sentence NEGATING `"skipped"` → `origin: "skipped"` carries
# that literal too, so the check passed on a doc saying the opposite. A pin a
# negation satisfies covers nothing, and the schema's rows are the only
# coverage that rule has.
