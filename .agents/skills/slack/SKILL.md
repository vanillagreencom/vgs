## Project Instructions

<!-- kendex:shared-instructions:start -->
Problems with a kendex-owned skill go through `kendex report`; check ownership in the file first.

VGS delivery policy overrides the shared workflow's mandatory review, CI-wait, branch-size and commit-hook gates. Work targets main. Reviews and PRs are optional; push directly or merge a PR immediately with gh, without a review loop, queue or CI wait. Do not arm git guards. Run scripts/validate once on the final relevant diff; use --changed <last-validated-commit> for a fix round, and reuse passing results while those inputs are unchanged. Do not rerun a full battery at commit, push or submission. Use --full only for an explicit full sweep or an unmapped dependency. Keep the live-session safety rules.

# Slack

The relay between one checkout's overseer mailbox and one private Slack channel. Every mailbox read and write goes through that checkout's `lane-mail`; the relay keeps its own record under `tmp/slack/`.

```bash
.agents/skills/slack/scripts/slack setup [--root ROOT] [--name NAME | --take CHANNEL_ID]
.agents/skills/slack/scripts/slack listen --root ROOT [--root ROOT]... [--once]
.agents/skills/slack/scripts/slack listen --status --root ROOT [--root ROOT]...
.agents/skills/slack/scripts/slack post [--root ROOT] [--channel ID] --text TEXT [--mention] [--file PATH] [--thread TS] [--update TS]
.agents/skills/slack/scripts/slack compact [--root ROOT]...
.agents/skills/slack/scripts/slack install --root ROOT [--root ROOT]... [--print]
```

What each verb does, every setting, and every keyed line: `slack --help`. Python 3.8 or newer, standard library only.

## Rules

- A root is a checkout with the orch skill installed. A relay serves every root it is given, and one relay serves one checkout, held by an OS lock.
- One relay per Slack app. Slack sends each owner message to one of an app's open Socket Mode connections, so a second relay on the same app takes part of the first one's messages, and each waits for the first relay's next reconnect. Each machine runs its own app and one relay over every root on it.
- The relay never reads or writes a mailbox file itself. An owner's words land through `lane-mail send --delivery-id` or `lane-mail resolve --delivery-id`; who judges a repeat is [DEVELOPMENT.md § Constraints](https://github.com/vanillagreencom/kendex/blob/main/skills/slack/DEVELOPMENT.md#constraints).
- The first owner reply in a question's thread closes the question. The ruling the overseer records reaches Slack as a notice with `--ref`, per [orch communication-modes.md § Owner asks](../orch/references/communication-modes.md#owner-asks).
- Every outbound text and file passes the secret-value pattern the orch skill ships at `references/secret-value.ere`. A match is refused, journaled and never sent.
- A relay reads its settings at start. After changing `SLACK_OWNERS`, run `slack setup` for each bound root: it invites an added owner to the channel and restarts the unit `install` wrote. A plain restart drops a removed owner but never invites an added one. After changing either token, restart the relay.
- The journal holds identifiers only: [schemas/journal.md](schemas/journal.md).
- The channel binding is installation state written by `setup`, never a setting. The alert channel is the caller's `--channel` argument.
- Settings live in the project's `kendex.settings.toml` and the two tokens, `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`, in its private env file: [kendex.settings.toml.example](kendex.settings.toml.example).

## Message standard

- `slack post` text without `--file`, and the relay's ask, notice and answer posts, go out as standard Markdown, which Slack renders: `**bold**`, lists, headings, links and code blocks.
- Slack takes at most 12,000 characters of standard Markdown. `slack post` refuses a longer text `text-too-long`; send the long part as a file. The relay posts a longer text as Slack's mrkdwn, its Markdown marks shown as typed, so an ask still reaches the owner before its deadline.
- A file's comment, the text beside `--file` or a notice's `--attach`, renders as Slack's own mrkdwn markup, not standard Markdown. It is outside the 12,000-character cap, and Slack's own message limits still bound it. How to write it: [orch communication-modes.md § Owner messages](../orch/references/communication-modes.md#owner-messages), the rule for a text sent beside a file.
- The words and markup of every post follow [orch communication-modes.md § Owner messages](../orch/references/communication-modes.md#owner-messages).

## Doctor row

`slack listen --status` prints one `slack: slack-relay=ROOT state=ok|failing|stale|never` line per root, with `connection=connected|reconnecting|disconnected` and `connection_since=`; a `never` line carries only `fix=`. A state other than `ok` carries `fix=`. A relay reconnecting past the bound the status record states reads `failing`. The fields of the row: [schemas/journal.md § The status record](schemas/journal.md#the-status-record).
