"""The listener: one process, every bound root on one machine, over one
Socket Mode connection.

Slack sends each Events API envelope to one of an app's open connections,
with no pattern to which, so one relay holds its app's one connection for
every root on its machine and routes each message event by its channel. The
relay opens the connection with SLACK_APP_TOKEN, acknowledges each envelope
by its envelope_id as soon as its loop reads it, before the delivery, then
routes a message event to the root bound to its channel: a top-level
message, or a reply under a bound thread that `live` accepts. The loop is
one thread, so an envelope that waits behind a download, a catch-up, the
mailbox posts or a 429 wait past Slack's three seconds is sent again, and
the journal skips the repeat by its stamp.

An event moves no position. It writes no `seen` or `thread` line; the
catch-up writes both, and a start with no seeds writes the `seen` line of
the binding moment. The catch-up runs on the first poll after every connect
and reconnect, and on the next poll after an event whose delivery was
refused. It reads the
channel's history from the journal's position or SLACK_THREAD_DAYS back,
whichever is older, delivers the top-level messages past the position, and
reads the thread of every open ask and of every live parent whose latest
reply moved. So a message sent while the relay was disconnected, one whose
envelope never arrived, and one acknowledged before a stop cut its delivery
off all land on a catch-up, and lane-mail's delivery id judges any repeat.
The connection opens before the catch-up reads, so no message falls between
them.

Each poll, every SLACK_POLL_SECONDS, per root: re-resolve the owners when
the setting moved, run the catch-up when one is due, mark every delivered
directive the journal holds no mark for, swap the receipt mark of every
directive the overseer has read since, then read the mailbox's events and
post every owner-bound envelope not yet carried.

A directive's Slack message carries a receipt mark, a reaction and never a
message: SEEN once it lands in the mailbox, READ once the overseer's
to-lane.cursor passes it. Each mark is judged from the journal on every
poll, never from the step that delivered the directive, so a stop between
the delivery and its mark leaves the mark to the next poll.

A start whose journal holds no `start` line seeds both positions before it
reads anything: Slack from the binding moment, so a channel's earlier history is never delivered,
and the mailbox from its newest envelope, so notices and answers already
there are never re-posted. Open asks are posted whatever their age inside
SLACK_THREAD_DAYS, since they still want an answer.

While SLACK_MASTER_FILE is younger than SLACK_MASTER_MAX_AGE a master session
answers the overseer, and the relay posts no envelope from the mailbox;
reading the channel and replying there go on. When the file goes stale or
absent the relay resumes: a notice written after the file's mtime the hold's
first poll read and before the hold ended never posts, any other does, open
asks post, and a held answer still posts so the thread of an ask the channel
shows open is closed. Neither end comes from what the relay posted, so a gap
in its polls can post a notice the master saw, never drop one it did not.
