"""The Slack Web API client: one method per call, honouring 429.

Every call is counted with its time so `--status` can print the calls used
in the last minute. A 429 is honoured by `Retry-After` up to RETRIES times;
an `ok: false` answer names Slack's error; an auth error is its own key
because its remedy is a new token and nothing else.

A network failure is one of two keys, by where urllib raised it. urllib wraps
every error of the request phase, the connect, the TLS handshake and the
write of the body, in `URLError`: Slack never read the request, so the call
is `slack-unreachable` and is safe to make again. An error raised bare comes
from the response phase, after the request was written: Slack may have acted
on it, so the call is `slack-response-lost`. The relay journals an envelope
post lost this way as unknown and never repeats it; a read is made again on
the next poll.

A file download is no API method: Slack answers it with the file, an HTTP
status, or, when the app lacks `files:read`, its sign-in page with 200. A
body that ends short of its Content-Length reads as a clean end in
http.client, so the download counts the bytes itself. A chunked body cut
short raises http.client's own `HTTPException`, which the download alone
refuses as `file-not-fetched`; every other call leaves it uncaught.
