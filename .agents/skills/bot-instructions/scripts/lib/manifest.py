"""`[bot-instructions.exclusions] derive_render`: the install manifest, and what it derives.

**The manifest is the one kendex resolves, never a hardcoded filename.** That
is `kendex.toml`, except where it declares `is_source_catalog = true` and
install state routes to the sibling `kendex-local.toml`. Opening `kendex.toml`
by name in such a repo parses a present, valid file and derives an empty set.

**What a harness root contributes.** Each immediate subdirectory of a declared
render root that holds a tracked path, and never an entry at its root, whether
that entry is a file or a symlink — kendex merges its own
entries into `.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/config.toml` and
`.pi/settings.json` while the repo owns the rest, and a glob one shape too
wide would silence review on a file this repo can fix. `tree.subdirs` answers
that from the index alone, identically in both modes.
`skills/review-gate/references/vendored-paths.md` § The harness-render variant
draws the same line for the review gate's own set.
