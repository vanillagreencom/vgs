# `mergeable` is permanently UNKNOWN after a merge, so running the readiness
# checks against a merged PR invented blockers — `unknown:`, `ci_pending:` from
# post-merge runs, `unresolved_threads:` from post-merge bot comments — and
# returned BLOCKED, which drives a caller to re-arm a merge that already
# happened. A merged or closed PR is terminal and short-circuits every mode.
