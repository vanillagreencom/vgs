# No path merges past the merge queue. On a base that requires one, the lane's
# routes pass no --admin and GitHub enrolls the PR, so the only merge they can
# cause is the queue's own. The must-fail inverse is an unconditional --admin
# on the command: each row's trace then names merge:admin and reds. The retired
# settings refuse every mode before the first GitHub call; the inverse is every
# other row in this file, which runs with all three keys unset and reaches gh.
