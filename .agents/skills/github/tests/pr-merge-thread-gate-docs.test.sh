# Docs regression tests for pr-merge's review-thread gate (kendex#825).
#
# pr-merge counts only threads that are unresolved AND not outdated, which is
# deliberately narrower than GitHub's required_conversation_resolution. That
# divergence, the fact that the gate binds only merges routed through the
# skill, and the recovery path for outdated threads that block a merge while
# being unreachable in the UI all live in prose only. These tests pin that
# prose to the real script behavior so neither side can drift silently.
