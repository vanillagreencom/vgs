# The wrapper launches its full-decision-table replays from inside the

# This proves the wrapper's teardown owns the whole replay TREE — the
# selftest and the layer below it that a per-pid kill cannot reach — on both
# arms that reach teardown: an early exit, and a signal.
#
# Every variant is the wrapper itself, edited by exact line, so what is
# proven is the shipped teardown and not a copy of its shape. Three of them
# exist to make the other two falsifiable: with teardown's signalling
# removed, with its group kill narrowed to a per-pid kill, and with the
# post-launch `set +m` removed, the assertions below must go red.
#
# The abort fires after TWO replays are outstanding, so teardown's loop is
# proven past n=1, and survivors are polled to zero against a deadline
# rather than sampled once — bash's own wait reaps only the replay subshell,
# never the descendant being counted.
