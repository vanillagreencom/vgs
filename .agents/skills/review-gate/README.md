# review-gate

Blocks a merge until the PR head has actually been **reviewed** — by a bot, a
human, or whatever mix your repo uses. One predicate answers "is this exact
head reviewed?", one workflow posts that answer as a commit status your
branch rules require.

A green gate is not always proof of a review: under `REVIEW_GATE_MODE = "off"`
the predicate reads no evidence at all and posts success attesting that the
gate is disabled, and merge-queue statuses post success unread as
"merge-queue entry: post-approval by construction". Both say so in the status
description — [references/settings.md](references/settings.md) §
`REVIEW_GATE_MODE`.

It does **not** run or inspect your tests. That is branch protection's job.

## What you do

Three things, once.

**1. Vendor the skill and commit it.** `kendex refresh` writes
`.agents/skills/review-gate/`. GitHub Actions checks out only tracked files,
so a machine-local install — symlinked or untracked — does not exist in CI.
If the engine is not in the commit, the gate is not in your CI.

**2. Copy the workflow.** `.agents/skills/review-gate/templates/review-gate-writer.yml`
into `.github/workflows/`. Copy it **verbatim**: it carries no per-repo
values. The file is yours after the copy — `kendex refresh` never syncs
workflow YAML.

**3. Add one CI step that validates the install**, and require the gate
context (your `REVIEW_GATE_CONTEXT` value) in the ruleset alongside your test
aggregate.

```yaml
  review-gate-validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@<pinned-sha>
        with:
          persist-credentials: false
      - run: .agents/skills/review-gate/scripts/validate.sh
```

`validate.sh` checks **your** repo: the engine is installed and runnable,
your committed `REVIEW_GATE_*` values are legal, your carry-forward
exclusions still match something in your tree, and your adopted workflow
still meets the template's contract. One verdict line per check; exit 0 all
clear, 1 findings, 2 could not run. It never re-runs the engine's own tests —
those run in the kendex repo, on every change to the engine.

Wiring, rulesets, merge-queue settings, and what an adoption PR deletes:
[references/adoption.md](references/adoption.md).

## Before you adopt it

Your repo must satisfy **one** of these, or untested code can reach main and
this engine will not stop it:

- **a merge queue** whose required checks include your test suite
  (recommended — the suite runs once, on the merged result), or
- **no held-back jobs**: every required check runs on every push.

Held back with no queue, tests record as *skipped*, which GitHub counts as
satisfied — a reviewed PR would merge untested.

## What counts as "reviewed"

A review approval at the exact head, a trusted clean-analysis check or status
on that head, a trusted bot's comment bound to that head's sha, or an
operator override carrying a written reason. A standing changes-requested or
any unresolved review thread blocks whatever else is present, and a failed
evidence read says so loudly and posts nothing rather than guessing.

Push a new commit and evidence resets — it is bound to the exact head. The
one exception is opt-in **carry-forward**: a docs-only or comment-only change,
or a `kendex refresh` under the render trees you list, can carry the previous
head's review, so fixing a typo after review does not restart the cycle.

## Settings

Every per-repo value is a `REVIEW_GATE_*` key in your own
`kendex.settings.toml` (environment wins over the file, which wins over the
built-in default). Nothing repo-specific is hard-coded anywhere else. The
keys most repos set are the gate's status context, the reviewer contexts and
logins to trust, and whether carry-forward is on.

One name is not a settings key: `REVIEW_GATE_CHECK_RUN_NAME` is a **GitHub
repository variable**, set under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.
The relay reads it in a workflow expression, before any checkout exists, so
the settings file cannot supply it — and `validate.sh` rejects it there,
where it would resolve to nothing. It matters only with the opt-in
`check_run` trigger ([references/adoption.md](references/adoption.md)).
