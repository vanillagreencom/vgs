# The awaiting verdict's status description. review-predicate.sh calls this on
# its awaiting arm and prints the result as the pending status.
#
# This script decides NOTHING about evidence. Which sources could still open
# the gate at this head is the predicate's judgment — it resolves the trust
# settings, applies each source's policy and filters the PR author — and it
# passes the answer in. All that happens here is fitting that answer into the
# 140 characters GitHub keeps of a commit-status description.
#
# The text names what THIS repo is waiting for rather than asserting who
# reviews: a gate whose trust lists hold only human logins reads those
# people's names, a gate trusting bots reads the bots.
#
# Inputs (environment): HEAD_SHA, and SOURCES as one eligible source per line.
# Output: the description on stdout, no trailing newline.
#
# A real trust list is longer than the whole limit on its own, so the sha
# shortens to its 12-character prefix before any name is dropped, and the
# names that still do not fit are counted rather than cut mid-word.
