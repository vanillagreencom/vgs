# Pins for fail-closed collection in scripts/size-ratchet: the gate must
# distinguish "measured and fine" from "could not measure" and refuse
# loudly on the latter. Two historic fail-opens are pinned here:
#   (1) an unreadable index blob was recorded as absent and skipped, so an
#       over-threshold unbaselined file passed as "OK — 0 checked";
#   (2) `grep -c … || true` on the violations count turned a grep
#       execution failure into an empty count and a passing verdict.
# Every other guarded collection site is pinned the same way: the two
# baseline-hygiene validations (worktree + index copy), the --update row
# count, and the worktree read guard (wc failure).
# Each shim scenario carries a shim-free control first, so a green run is
# evidence, not a check that cannot fail; the shim's own stderr text is
# asserted in the failing case to pin the cause to the shim.
