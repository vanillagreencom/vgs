# shellcheck shell=bash
# Settings resolution for size-ratchet. Sourced (not executed) by
# scripts/size-ratchet.
#
# VENDORED from skills/review-gate/scripts/lib/settings.sh (rg_setting),
# renamed sr_setting: skills are standalone-installable, so a consumer that
# installs only size-ratchet has no review-gate tree to source from. Keep
# the logic in sync with the original; behavioral fixes belong there first.
#
# Resolution order for every key read through sr_setting (the SIZE_RATCHET_*
# family):
#   1. explicit environment — a SET variable wins even when set to the empty
#      string, so a caller can force "explicitly empty";
#   2. .env.local (KEY=value, quotes optional — parsed, never sourced);
#   3. .vstack/settings.toml, then the repo's committed vstack.settings.toml
#      (sole uncommented `KEY = "value"` assignment; an explicit
#      SIZE_RATCHET_SETTINGS_FILE consults only itself);
#   4. .env (same shape);
#   5. the built-in default passed by the caller.
#
# SIZE_RATCHET_SETTINGS_FILE=/dev/null is the force-defaults handle and means
# NO settings source at all: layers 2-4 are skipped whole, leaving explicit
# environment variables and the built-in defaults.
#
# The parser reads flat single-line basic-string TOML assignments only —
# exactly the shape vstack.settings.toml [env] blocks use.
#
# Keys are matched FILE-WIDE by exact name, with no TOML-table awareness:
# adopter settings sit under an [env] table, and a table-aware top-level
# parser would resolve none of them. The consequence is a contract: every
# key name read through sr_setting is reserved across the whole file — an
# assignment under an unrelated table would be read as the setting, so
# callers must keep these names unique file-wide. The one detectable
# ambiguity, the same name assigned more than once, fails loud below.
#
# The caller cds to the repo root before resolving, so the default settings
# path is relative.

# Extract the value of one parsed dotenv assignment (text after `KEY=`).
# Quoted values end at the FIRST closing delimiter — dotenv/shell
# semantics; an embedded delimiter would need escaping, which this parser
# does not support — so a quote inside a trailing comment can never leak
# into the value: KEY="500" # say "ratchet" assigns 500. Anything else
# after the closing quote (an adjacent segment like KEY="tools/base".tsv)
# is a shape this parser cannot read and fails NONZERO — truncating it
# would silently load the wrong value. Unquoted values end at the first
# whitespace: KEY=500 # ratchet assigns 500.
