# Size Ratchet

> **Problem with this skill?** Run `vstack report` — it files to the owning repo automatically. Do not hand-file.

One check, one direction: **no tracked file gets bigger than its threshold,
and the files already over it only shrink.** Existing offenders are frozen
in a baseline at their current line counts; everything else must stay at or
under the threshold its path class carries. The baseline is a ratchet, not
a ledger: rows only go down or away, and the only way a number goes up is a
human editing the row in a reviewed diff.

```bash
.agents/skills/size-ratchet/scripts/size-ratchet            # check (pre-PR / CI)
.agents/skills/size-ratchet/scripts/size-ratchet --staged   # check what a commit records (git hook)
.agents/skills/size-ratchet/scripts/size-ratchet --update   # tighten the baseline
.agents/skills/size-ratchet/scripts/size-ratchet --seed     # write the FIRST baseline
```

`--staged` judges the commit's snapshot: index blobs, and index policy.
Details in [README.md](README.md).

## Verdicts

`check` scans every tracked file (`git ls-files`) minus the exclusion list
and fails (exit 1) on any of:

| Failure | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **new offender** | Over its threshold with no baseline row. |
| **baselined file grew** | Actual lines exceed the file's baseline row. |
| **baseline looser than reality** | A row higher than the file's actual count, a row for a file now at/under its threshold, or a row for a file no longer tracked (or now excluded). Slack in the baseline is itself a failure — the ratchet must move down. |

Every diagnostic names the file, its count and the baseline row it violated,
and — wherever a threshold decided the verdict — that threshold and whether
it came from a class pattern or the default, plus the remedies: *split at a
concept seam, or raise the baseline row in this diff with justification*.

Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` violations, `2` usage/config/collection error
(malformed baseline or excludes, bad threshold, a tracked path containing
a tab or newline, or a file the gate could not measure). Line counts are
newline counts (`wc -l`). A tracked file absent from the worktree
(unstaged deletion, sparse checkout) is counted from the INDEX blob — a
partial tree can neither smuggle a new offender past the gate nor loosen a
baselined row; an index blob that cannot be read is a collection error
(exit 2, naming the file), never a skip. A submodule gitlink at a tracked
path is not a countable file.

## `--update` — tighten only

`--update` rewrites the baseline to current reality in the downward
direction only: rows are lowered to the actual count or removed (file
shrank to/under its own threshold, was deleted, or is now excluded). It **never
adds a row and never raises a number** — a grown file keeps its old row and
keeps failing, and a new offender stays a failure. Deliberate growth or a
new freeze is a hand-edit of the baseline TSV, visible in the diff. After
the rewrite the check re-runs, so `--update` exits 1 while growth or new
offenders remain.

## `--seed` — bootstrap only

`--seed` writes the FIRST baseline from the gate's own collector: every
tracked, non-excluded file over its deciding threshold enters at its
current count, sorted, with a self-row when the baseline outgrows its own
threshold. A baseline that already has rows refuses — the ratchet is live
there, and growth stays a reviewed hand-edit. Commit the seeded file.

## Configuration

Resolution order for every key: explicit environment > `.env.local`
(personal, untracked) > `.vstack/settings.toml` > the repo's committed
`vstack.settings.toml` (flat `KEY = "value"` under `[env]`) > `.env` >
built-in default. Only an ABSENT source is skipped: a source that exists
but is unusable — unreadable, a directory, FIFO, socket or device, or a
symlink that does not resolve — is a config error (exit 2), never a
fall-through to the next layer. `/dev/null` forces the built-in defaults.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SIZE_RATCHET_THRESHOLD` | `400` | Line threshold for paths matching no class. |
| `SIZE_RATCHET_CLASSES` | *(none)* | `pattern=threshold` entries separated by `;`, first match wins. |
| `SIZE_RATCHET_BASELINE` | `tools/size-ratchet-baseline.tsv` | Baseline path (also `--baseline FILE`). |
| `SIZE_RATCHET_EXCLUDES` | `tools/size-ratchet-excludes` | Exclusion-list path (also `--excludes FILE`). |

**Path classes** — a file's threshold is the first `SIZE_RATCHET_CLASSES`
pattern it matches, else `SIZE_RATCHET_THRESHOLD`. Patterns are the excludes
file's globs and every other semantic is per file, so a class only moves the
number a path is judged against:

```toml
SIZE_RATCHET_CLASSES = "tests/*=800;*/tests/*=800;*.test.*=800"
```

A directory name needs both forms: `*/tests/*` requires a slash-delimited
prefix, so a root-level `tests/` matches only `tests/*`.

A malformed entry (no `=`, an empty pattern, a non-positive-integer
threshold) is a config error naming the entry; an unset or empty value is
single-threshold behavior.

**Baseline format** — `path<TAB>lines`, `LC_ALL=C` sorted, unique paths,
counts above the path's threshold. **Excludes format** — `pattern<TAB>reason` per
line (shell glob against the full repo-relative path; `*` crosses `/`);
blank lines and `#` comments are ignored, and a pattern without a reason is
a config error — every exclusion carries its justification (generated,
vendored, fixtures, lockfiles).

using this format: [README.md](README.md).
