#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Selftest for review-predicate.sh — pins the gate's decision table without
# touching the network. This is the engine's portable proof: every consumer's
# CI runs it in a deliberately UNGATED job (a broken predicate approves
# nothing, so a selftest behind the gate could never run when it matters).
#
# Why this exists: the predicate is the single thing standing between
# "reviewed" and "merged", it is only ever exercised in production, and every
# widening of its evidence sources is a place the gate could be made to say
# "approved" when nothing reviewed anything. The dangerous direction is not a
# false `awaiting` — that is visible and annoying — it is a false `approved`,
# which is silent. So every case below that ends in `approved` is paired with
# a near-miss that must NOT.
#
# TWO LAYERS:
#   1. Mechanism layer — env-forced configurations pin every engine behavior
#      with known values: the evidence sources, the trust model near-misses,
#      the skip-pattern (pass-without-analysis) filter, review-object trust,
#      approval non-supersession, fail-loud reads, and config validation.
#   2. Configured layer — the same approve/near-miss discipline re-derived
#      from THIS repo's resolved REVIEW_GATE_* settings (env >
#      vstack.settings.toml > defaults), so a repo trusting a different bot
#      tests its OWN trust list, not someone else's defaults.
#
# Mechanism: a `gh` shim earlier on PATH answers from fixtures and applies any
# `--jq` filter with real jq, so the predicate runs unmodified. Run:
#
#   .agents/skills/review-gate/scripts/review-predicate-selftest.sh
#
# Exit 0 = all cases pass. Any failure prints the case, the expectation and
# what the predicate actually said.
