# Review-gate convergence for ONE pull request head — the single source of
# truth for how review-state transitions reach the merge-blocking gate commit
# status and the CI runs behind it. Shipped by the vstack review-gate skill;
# vendored into consumers at .agents/skills/review-gate/scripts/.
#
# Model: the repo's CI gate job evaluates review-predicate.sh and posts the
# gate commit status (context: REVIEW_GATE_CONTEXT) on the PR head —
# `pending` until review evidence exists (blocks merge without a false red),
# `failure` only on changes-requested, `success` only from a run attempt that
# executed with the gate open (heavy jobs skip while it is closed). This
# script converges the status when review state changes between runs:
#
#   verdict != approved   → POST the pending/failure status directly. No
#                           reruns: pending blocks merge on its own, so a
#                           dismissed review or reopened thread needs no
#                           check-run churn.
#   verdict == approved   → the status may read `success` ONLY in two ways:
#     (a) a PRIOR gate success exists on this same sha — proof an approved
#         attempt already executed its jobs here (a red build from that
#         attempt stays blocked by its own red required contexts) — then
#         post success directly, sparing a pointless full re-run;
#     (b) otherwise RERUN the head's completed pull_request runs: the new
#         attempt's gate job re-evaluates, posts success, and the heavy
#         jobs actually run. Never post success without (a): pre-review
#         attempts SKIP the heavy jobs, and skipped required checks satisfy
#         rulesets, so a directly-posted success would merge untested code.
#
# Callers (see the skill's templates/):
#   - approval-rerun.yml (event-driven: review submitted/dismissed, trusted
#     check_run/status evidence, comment-form reviewer comments)   QUIESCE=1
#   - approval-sweep.yml (scheduled: transitions that emit no usable Actions
#     event, chiefly resolving the last review thread)             QUIESCE=0
#
# Env (required): GH_TOKEN (or ambient gh auth), GH_REPO, PR_NUMBER, HEAD_SHA
# Env (optional):
#   PR_AUTHOR     resolved from the PR when empty.
#   QUIESCE       "1" (default): wait (bounded) for in-progress runs on the
#                 head to complete before a rerun decision. "0": act on
#                 completed runs only (the next scheduled pass catches
#                 stragglers).
# Settings (lib/settings.sh — env > vstack.settings.toml > default):
#   REVIEW_GATE_CONTEXT             gate commit-status context (default "Review gate")
#   REVIEW_GATE_MAX_RERUN_ATTEMPTS  rerun backstop (default 5): runs at/above
#                 the cap are left alone (gh run rerun retries manually).
#                 Attempts only grow on the first awaiting→approved flip per
#                 head, so the cap exists for pathological ping-pong, not
#                 normal review cycles. Legacy MAX_ATTEMPTS env is honored.
#
# Read errors fail LOUDLY (exit 1) without taking any action: treating a
# transient API failure as absent evidence could flip a healthy PR's state.
