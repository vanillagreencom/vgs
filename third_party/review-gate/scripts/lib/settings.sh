# shellcheck shell=bash
# Settings resolution for the review-gate engine. Sourced (not executed) by
# review-predicate.sh, approval-refire.sh and the selftest.
#
# Resolution order for every REVIEW_GATE_* key:
#   1. explicit environment — a SET variable wins even when set to the empty
#      string, so a caller (or the selftest) can force "explicitly empty";
#   2. the repo's committed vstack.settings.toml (the file's sole uncommented
#      `KEY = "value"` assignment; the file path can be overridden with
#      REVIEW_GATE_SETTINGS_FILE, e.g. /dev/null to force built-in defaults);
#   3. the built-in default passed by the caller.
#
# The parser reads flat single-line basic-string TOML assignments only —
# exactly the shape vstack.settings.toml [env] blocks use. List-valued keys
# therefore pack multiple items into one string with ';' separators.
#
# Keys are matched FILE-WIDE by exact name, with no TOML-table awareness:
# adopter settings sit under an [env] table, and a table-aware top-level
# parser would resolve none of them. The consequence is a contract: every
# key name read through rg_setting is reserved across the whole file — an
# assignment under an unrelated table would be read as the setting, so
# callers must keep these names unique file-wide. The one detectable
# ambiguity, the same name assigned more than once, fails loud below.
#
# Scripts run from the repo root in CI (workflow working directory), so the
# default settings path is relative.
