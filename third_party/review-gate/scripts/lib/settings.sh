# Settings resolution for the review-gate engine. Sourced (not executed) by
# review-predicate.sh, approval-refire.sh and the selftest.
#
# Resolution order for every REVIEW_GATE_* key:
#   1. explicit environment — a SET variable wins even when set to the empty
#      string, so a caller (or the selftest) can force "explicitly empty";
#   2. the repo's committed vstack.settings.toml (first uncommented
#      `KEY = "value"` assignment; the file path can be overridden with
#      REVIEW_GATE_SETTINGS_FILE, e.g. /dev/null to force built-in defaults);
#   3. the built-in default passed by the caller.
#
# The parser reads flat single-line basic-string TOML assignments only —
# exactly the shape vstack.settings.toml [env] blocks use. List-valued keys
# therefore pack multiple items into one string with ';' separators.
#
# Scripts run from the repo root in CI (workflow working directory), so the
# default settings path is relative.
