# Review-gate predicate — the single source of truth for "is this PR head
# reviewed?". Shipped by the vstack review-gate skill and vendored into
# consumers at .agents/skills/review-gate/scripts/. Callers: the repo's CI
# gate job (posts the merge-blocking commit status from the verdict) and
# approval-refire.sh (converges the status when review state changes).
#
# Predicate: review evidence present for the CURRENT head — any of
#   (a) a review OBJECT at the exact head from a non-author, non-dismissed,
#       trusted login (trust list empty = any non-author);
#   (b) a trusted clean-analysis CHECK-RUN or legacy COMMIT STATUS succeeding
#       on this head, whose title/summary/description carries no
#       skip-pattern marker (a "pass" that says the analysis was rate
#       limited, skipped or queued proves nothing ran — it is silence, not
#       approval, and routes to NOT-EVIDENCE, never to failure);
#   (c) a trusted comment-form clean pass: an issue comment by a trusted bot
#       login whose body binds the evidence to this head's sha;
#   (d) the trusted reviewer-outage attestation status — substitutes for
#       MISSING evidence only;
# AND no STANDING changes-requested (each reviewer's latest decisive review
# across the WHOLE PR — GitHub keeps an objection standing across pushes
# until re-approval or dismissal, so the reduction must not be scoped to the
# head; positive evidence stays exact-head) AND zero unresolved review
# threads. Changes-requested and unresolved threads always fail closed, even
# with evidence present.
#
# APPROVAL IS NEVER SUPERSEDED BY A LATER COMMENT. The evidence reduction is
# "an accepted review row exists at head" — never "the latest review per
# reviewer" — so a reviewer that posts APPROVED and then a trailing COMMENTED
# on the same commit still counts as approval. Only a LATER
# CHANGES_REQUESTED from the same login withdraws it (and the separate
# changes-requested term fails the gate then anyway). The selftest pins this.
#
# TRUST MODEL: trust keys on NAMES ONLY GITHUB CONTROLS — the author login of
# a review or comment (exact match on the app's bot login) or the exact
# context/name of a check/status on repos where every publisher is trusted. A
# comment BODY is never trusted to establish trust; it is read only to BIND
# the evidence to a specific commit, so a stale comment cannot vouch for a
# later push.
#
# Per-repo trust configuration comes from REVIEW_GATE_* settings — explicit
# environment first, then the repo's vstack.settings.toml, then built-in
# defaults (lib/settings.sh). Keys read here:
#   REVIEW_GATE_TRUSTED_STATUS_CONTEXTS       (b) check/status names, ';'-separated
#   REVIEW_GATE_CHECKRUN_SKIP_PATTERNS        (b) pass-without-analysis markers, ';'-separated,
#                                             case-insensitive substrings; empty disables
#   REVIEW_GATE_COMMENT_REVIEWERS             (c) 'login:binding-pattern' pairs, ';'-separated
#                                             (first ':' splits; pattern is a literal prefix)
#   REVIEW_GATE_SHA_PREFIX_FLOOR              (c) shortest sha prefix a comment may bind
#   REVIEW_GATE_OUTAGE_CONTEXT                (d) attestation status context; empty disables
#   REVIEW_GATE_REVIEW_OBJECT_TRUSTED_LOGINS  (a) trust list; empty = any non-author
#   REVIEW_GATE_REVIEW_OBJECT_MIN_STATE       (a) "any" (any review row) or "approved"
#                                             (an APPROVED row not withdrawn by a later
#                                             CHANGES_REQUESTED from the same login)
#
# Env (required): GH_TOKEN (or ambient gh auth), GH_REPO, PR_NUMBER, HEAD_SHA

# (diagnostic detail also echoed for logs). Exit codes:
#   0 — evaluated (verdict line is authoritative)
#   2 — an evidence read failed or the configuration is invalid; NO verdict
#       was reached. Callers must treat this as "take no action", never as
