# review-gate

Blocks a merge until the PR head has actually been **reviewed** — by a bot, a
human, or whatever mix a repo uses. It answers one question and posts the
answer as a commit status your branch rules require.

It does **not** check your tests. That is your branch protection's job, and
keeping the two separate is what makes this small enough to trust.

```

The two columns are independent on purpose. The gate never inspects your CI,
and your CI never waits on the gate. Your branch rules require both.

**Where the CI savings come from:** the left column does not have to be your
full test suite. The recommended shape runs only fast, cheap checks on each
push — so multiple rounds of bot review never re-bill the expensive tests —
and lets the merge queue run the full suite exactly once, on the merged
result, after review is done. Repos that want maximum signal per push can
still run everything on every push; that is a per-repo CI choice this engine
deliberately stays out of.

## What the gate accepts as "reviewed"

Different reviewers signal differently, so the predicate accepts any of:

- a **review approval** at the exact head from a trusted login;
- a **clean-analysis check or status** succeeding on that head — for bots that
  only file a review when they have complaints (a "pass" that says *rate
  limited* or *skipped* is treated as silence, not approval);
- a **comment-form pass** binding a trusted bot's comment to that head's sha;
- an **operator override** status carrying a written reason — the escape
  hatch for when every reviewer is down. It substitutes for *missing*
  evidence only: it can never override a changes-requested or an unresolved
  thread.

A standing changes-requested or any unresolved review thread always blocks,
whatever else is present. If an evidence read fails, the gate says so loudly
and posts nothing rather than guessing.

Push a new commit and evidence resets — it is bound to the exact head. The
one exception is opt-in **carry-forward**: a docs-only or comment-only change
can carry the previous head's review, so fixing a typo after review doesn't
restart the whole cycle.

## Before you adopt it

Your repo must satisfy **one** of these, or untested code can reach main and
this engine will not stop it:

1. **A merge queue** whose required checks include your test suite
   (recommended). The queue runs the suite on the merged result — once, on
   the code that actually ships.
2. **No held-back jobs** — every required check runs on every push.

The failure mode this prevents: if you hold tests back until review and have
no queue, GitHub records the held-back tests as *skipped*, and skipped counts
as satisfied. A reviewed PR would merge untested.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | The agent-facing contract: decision table, settings, operations. |
| `scripts/review-predicate.sh` | Answers "is this head reviewed?" — verdict on stdout, exit 2 means no verdict, take no action. |
| `scripts/review-writer.sh` | Posts that answer as the commit status. The whole writer. |
| `scripts/review-predicate-selftest.sh` | Offline proof of the decision table; runs ungated in CI so a broken predicate reds its own job instead of approving everything. |
| `templates/review-gate-writer.yml` | The one workflow to copy in. Repo-owned after copying. |
| `tests/e2e-sandbox.sh` | Live replay against a throwaway repo — re-run it before changing the engine. |
| `references/adoption.md` | Wiring, branch rules, per-repo settings. |
| `references/settings.md` | Every `REVIEW_GATE_*` key and the security reasoning behind the trust ones. |

Nothing repo-specific is hard-coded: consumers vendor `scripts/` via
`vstack refresh` and configure trust in their own `vstack.settings.toml`.
