<!-- Copy to .github/instructions/ as a *.instructions.md file, and fill:
     [VENDORED_GLOB] the vendored tree, whose root is per-repo — verify it
     against a real re-vendor PR's file list rather than assuming an install
     path; [UPSTREAM_REPO] the owning repository; [PIN_CHECK] the repo-owned
     control that fails on byte drift. Delete this comment.
     Rationale and the verification protocol: review-gate
     references/vendored-paths.md. -->

This tree is vendored BYTE-PINNED from [UPSTREAM_REPO] — the bytes reviewed
upstream are the bytes that run here, and [PIN_CHECK] fails if they drift. The
same reviewers see this content upstream before it ever arrives.

**Route every finding by where its fix would land, and pick the surface from
that.**

- **The fix lands in a repo-owned file** — the vendor pin or checksum manifest,
  settings, CI wiring, adoption glue: comment inline as normal. A re-vendor
  that moves these bytes without updating the repo-owned pin is a real defect,
  and the most valuable finding on this PR class.
- **The fix lands in these vendored bytes**: put it in the REVIEW SUMMARY BODY,
  not an inline comment. Name the file and what is wrong; do not propose a
  diff. A local edit here forks the pinned surface, which is what the pin check
  exists to prevent — the remedy is upstream-then-re-vendor and cannot happen
  in this PR.
- **The fix lands in [UPSTREAM_REPO]'s own docs, config, or conventions** (its
  README, its settings tables, its test layout): summary body, or omit. This
  repo cannot act on it.

**Carve-out — a production-impacting regression these bytes introduce.** If
this bump brings in a correctness, security, or data-loss defect that will run
here, comment inline and say it blocks. That is the first rule, not an
exception to it: the remedy IS repo-owned — holding or reverting this vendor
bump until upstream fixes it acts on the pin, and blocking this PR is how that
remedy gets exercised. The bar is a defect you would hold a release for.
Style, naming, duplication, test layout, missing coverage, and "this could be
cleaner" never qualify, however severe they look — those are the summary-body
case above, and using this carve-out for them is what it exists to prevent.

Every inline comment opens a review thread that blocks the merge until someone
answers it, and this PR class lands in several consuming repos at once — one
upstream finding costs one blocking thread per reviewer per repo. The summary
body carries the same finding at no such cost and is harvested upstream once
per re-vendor train.

**If every finding you emit is anchored to a file location** — you have no
review body you author, only a fixed template — then do not drop the finding
and do not spread it. Post ONE consolidated comment for this PR carrying every
upstream-remedy finding together, anchored anywhere in this tree. One thread
per reviewer per PR is the bound; one thread per finding is what this
instruction exists to prevent.

If your output contract binds one finding to one comment and consolidation is
genuinely unavailable to you, every comment you post must still state plainly
that the remedy is upstream and must not ask for a local edit. That part is not
optional: it is what stops the same finding being re-litigated in the next
consuming repo.

**Do not stay silent instead.** Review the PR and submit a review: the merge
gate needs a review object at this head, so a skipped review blocks the merge
as hard as an unanswered thread does.

Also out of scope here, on any surface: local restructuring of this tree
(splitting files, style or naming changes, line-count limits, test
reorganization), requests for repo-local test suites over it, and cross-repo
sync timing — an upstream fix not yet re-vendored is a coordination note, never
a merge blocker.
