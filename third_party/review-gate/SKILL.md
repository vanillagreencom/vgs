# Review Gate

> **Problem with this skill?** Run `vstack report` — it files to the owning repo automatically. Do not hand-file.

The gate answers ONE question: **has this exact PR head been reviewed?** It
posts that answer as a commit status the repo's branch rules require. It does
not check CI, re-run anything, or reason about jobs.

Two greens do NOT mean a review happened. Under `REVIEW_GATE_MODE = "off"`
the predicate evaluates no evidence and attests only that the repo disabled
the gate; and merge-group statuses never read the mode, posting green as
"merge-queue entry: post-approval by construction". Both:
[references/settings.md](references/settings.md) § `REVIEW_GATE_MODE`.

## Decision table

| Verdict | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `approved` | `success` | Evidence exists for this head; no standing objection; no unresolved threads. Under `REVIEW_GATE_MODE = "off"` the predicate evaluates NO term — success there means only "gate disabled", stated in the status description. |
| `awaiting` | `pending` | No review evidence for this head yet. |
| `threads-open` | `pending` | Evidence exists, but review threads are unresolved. |
| `changes-requested` | `failure` | A reviewer objects. Red means objection — never a build failure. |
| (exit 2, no verdict) | *unchanged* | A read failed or config is invalid. Take NO action; retry next pass. |

## ADOPTION PRECONDITION — check this first

Whether untested code can reach the default branch is branch protection's
job, so a repo must satisfy one of these or a reviewed PR merges untested:
**a merge queue** whose required contexts include the test aggregate
(recommended), or **no held-back jobs**. Held-back jobs report `skipped`,
and GitHub counts skipped as satisfied. Wiring and the sandbox proof:
[references/adoption.md](references/adoption.md) § The precondition.

## Evidence sources (`.agents/skills/review-gate/scripts/review-predicate.sh`)

Evidence for the CURRENT head is any of:

1. **Review object** at the exact head from a non-author, non-dismissed
   login — restricted to `REVIEW_GATE_REVIEW_OBJECT_TRUSTED_LOGINS` when set,
   and to APPROVED reviews when `REVIEW_GATE_REVIEW_OBJECT_MIN_STATE =
   "approved"`. An approval is never superseded by a later COMMENTED from the
   same reviewer; only a later CHANGES_REQUESTED withdraws it. A row whose
   body matches `REVIEW_GATE_REVIEW_OBJECT_ERROR_PATTERNS` (an errored
   auto-review's own "unable to review" attestation — the reviews API has no
   errored state) is NOT-EVIDENCE, never a failure: the review-object mirror
   of the skip-pattern rule below.
2. **Trusted clean-analysis check-run or commit status**
   (`REVIEW_GATE_TRUSTED_STATUS_CONTEXTS`) succeeding on this head — but a
   pass must prove analysis RAN: a success matching
   `REVIEW_GATE_CHECKRUN_SKIP_PATTERNS` (e.g. "rate limited") is
   NOT-EVIDENCE, never a failure. It is silence, which `awaiting` handles.
   On BOTH surfaces the NEWEST row/run per name decides (statuses by list
   order, check-runs by run id): an older clean success never outlives its
   reviewer's newer pending/failed/skip-marked round.
3. **Comment-form clean pass** (`REVIEW_GATE_COMMENT_REVIEWERS`): an issue
   comment by a trusted bot login — never the PR author, even if configured —
   binding the evidence to this head's sha (floor
   `REVIEW_GATE_SHA_PREFIX_FLOOR`).
4. **Operator override** (`REVIEW_GATE_OVERRIDE_CONTEXT`, legacy name
   `REVIEW_GATE_OUTAGE_CONTEXT`): a trusted operator's status carrying a
   NON-EMPTY reason, which is enforced and surfaced in the gate detail.
   Substitutes for MISSING evidence ONLY — it can never override a
   changes-requested or an unresolved thread, so the internal review must fix
   findings and resolve threads first, then attest.

With `REVIEW_GATE_CARRY_FORWARD` (off by default), evidence at an ancestor
carries to head when the delta is provably in a class review would not
re-examine — docs-only, comment-only, identical tree. Never a waiver: real
evidence must exist, code changes always require fresh evidence, and the
fail-closed terms still apply.

Changes-requested and unresolved threads always fail closed. Every evidence
read fails LOUD (exit 2, no verdict) — a transient API error must never flip
a healthy PR's state; reads retry in-process up to `REVIEW_GATE_API_ATTEMPTS`
(default 1), and a zero-byte producer is a failed read, not an empty page
set. Review threads are counted across pages (100 per page, bound 20
pages / 2000 threads); past the bound — or when pagination metadata
cannot advance — the count reports overflow and fails closed to
`threads-open`.

**Trust model.** Trust keys on names only GitHub controls: the author login
of a review or comment, or the exact check/status context on repos where
every publisher is trusted. A comment body never establishes trust — it is
read only to BIND evidence to a commit, so a stale comment cannot vouch for a
later push. Where PR workflows hold `statuses:write`, the opt-in
`REVIEW_GATE_STATUS_PUBLISHER_REJECT` list rejects statuses minted by a
forgeable creator (typically `github-actions[bot]`) on both the
trusted-context and override reads. Statuses are read from the per-commit
statuses LIST endpoint, where every real publisher — GitHub Apps included —
carries a creator login; while the reject list is configured, a status with
no creator login is an anomaly and is not evidence (with the list empty, the
default, the filter is off entirely).

## The writer (`.agents/skills/review-gate/scripts/review-writer.sh`)

One workflow, defined on the default branch, is the only thing that writes
the gate status. It evaluates the predicate and converges the status —
nothing else.

- **Converge-all on every leg.** Every invocation converges EVERY open PR,
  so a run evicted from the concurrency group strands nothing (8 evictions
  observed in one sandbox replay, zero stranded).
- **Relay / converge split.** PR-attached legs (`pull_request_target`,
  `pull_request_review`, `status`, an opted-in `check_run`) do NOT run the
  engine: they run a group-less relay job that dispatches a converge pass and
  exits. Only `workflow_dispatch` and `schedule` hold the single-writer group.
  Convergence is unchanged — what changes is WHERE an eviction's `CANCELLED`
  check lands: attached to a PR head it pinned that PR at `mergeStateStatus
  UNSTABLE` until a manual rerun, while nothing gates on the default-branch
  runs the relay dispatches into. It costs one non-evictable run per
  PR-attached event, coalescing nothing — size that before adopting on a
  capacity-limited runner pool ([references/adoption.md](references/adoption.md)
  § Updating an already-adopted copy).
- **The relay never exits non-zero — a pinned invariant, not a per-branch
  choice.** It holds no `statuses` scope, so a failed dispatch cannot make the
  gate look converged — only leave it stale, which the cron floor and
  `pr-watch --heal` already own. Reddening would re-create the exact
  `UNSTABLE` pin the split removes. Every fault warns and exits 0, and every
  wait is bounded, so a sustained dispatch outage surfaces as **gate
  staleness** across every open PR rather than as N red PRs. The retry
  taxonomy and the bounds are pinned in adoption.md § Updating an
  already-adopted copy — read it before editing a consumer's copy.
- **Write ordering.** Before any `success` post it re-reads the status and
  defers when any gate entry was created at/after this run's evaluation
  instant — a newer run's state AND description (which carries the audit
  detail) both stand; a failed re-read defers too. Downward posts never
  defer.
- **Idempotent.** When the current entry already matches state + description
  it no-ops, so idle cron ticks append nothing.
- **Forks need no special case** — every leg holds a write-capable
  default-branch token. The one exception is `pull_request_review` on a fork
  PR, whose token GitHub downgrades to read-only: it cannot dispatch, so
  that run exits green as a no-op and the cron floor converges it.
- **`pull_request_target` safety**: the job never executes PR-controlled
  code. Every checkout pins the default branch with credentials dropped.

```

## Operations

**Watching one or many PRs without stalling.** Never key a hand-rolled
monitor on gate-state transitions — a PR sitting steadily at "pending with
open threads" transitions nothing and you sleep through it. Run
`.agents/skills/review-gate/scripts/pr-watch.sh` (optionally `--heal`) on
the harness's wake-up mechanism instead: silence + exit 0 means nothing
needs you; attention
lines name exactly what does. See adoption.md § Watching PRs as an agent.

**Reviewers are down / nothing is reviewing.** Run the internal review loop:
fix findings, resolve every thread, then post the override status with a real
reason. It cannot bypass an objection or an open thread — that is the point.

**A PR that repairs the gate itself.** The writer always runs the merged
engine, so a broken predicate cannot open its own repair PR's gate. Merge it
with the ruleset's bypass actor (every fleet repo has one configured) and say
so in the commit message.

**A settings-change PR** is judged by the OLD config — a PR adding a trusted
login cannot have its own gate honor it. Merge via normal review or the
bypass actor.

## Settings

Every per-repo value is a `REVIEW_GATE_*` key (env > `vstack.settings.toml` >
default). Full table and the security reasoning:
[references/settings.md](references/settings.md).

## Selftest — the engine's portable proof

`.agents/skills/review-gate/scripts/review-predicate-selftest.sh` pins the
decision table offline, running the real predicate against the invoking
repo's own resolved settings — so a repo trusting a different bot tests its
own trust list. How it does that: [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) § How the
selftest pins the decision table.

Every consumer's CI must run it as a deliberately **ungated** job (own job,
no `needs`): a broken predicate approves nothing, so a selftest behind the
gate could never run when it matters.

## Adoption

Copy `.agents/skills/review-gate/templates/review-gate-writer.yml` into
`.github/workflows/` (repo-owned after copy; `vstack refresh` does not
sync workflow YAML), set the repo's
`REVIEW_GATE_*` values, add the ungated selftest job, and require the gate
context in the ruleset alongside the test aggregate. Full wiring:
[references/adoption.md](references/adoption.md). An adoption PR deletes the
local machinery it supersedes in the same PR — a redesign removes what it
replaces, never leaves it dormant.

A consumer also merges re-vendor PRs whose entire delta is bytes already
reviewed upstream. Suppress the duplicate findings with the remedy-locus
reviewer instruction, never a reviewer path exclusion — excluding the vendored
tree leaves a pure re-vendor PR with nothing to review, no review object, and a
gate that starves:
[references/vendored-paths.md](references/vendored-paths.md).
