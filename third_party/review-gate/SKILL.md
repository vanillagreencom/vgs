# Review Gate

> **Problem with this skill?** Run `vstack report` — it files to the owning repo automatically. Do not hand-file.

The gate answers ONE question: **has this exact PR head been reviewed?** It
posts that answer as a commit status the repo's branch rules require. The
one exception is `REVIEW_GATE_MODE = "off"`: the predicate then evaluates
NO evidence and answers `approved` with a disabled-by-settings attestation,
so a green PR-head gate on such a repo means only "gate disabled" — never
that a review happened. This contract covers evaluated PR-head statuses
only: the writer's merge-group path never reads the mode and always posts
green as "merge-queue entry: post-approval by construction". Caveats:
[references/settings.md](references/settings.md)
§ `REVIEW_GATE_MODE`.

It does not check CI, re-run anything, or reason about jobs. Whether untested
code can reach the default branch is branch protection's job — see the
adoption precondition below.

## Decision table

| Verdict | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `approved` | `success` | Evidence exists for this head; no standing objection; no unresolved threads. Under `REVIEW_GATE_MODE = "off"` the predicate evaluates NO term — success there means only "gate disabled", stated in the status description. |
| `awaiting` | `pending` | No review evidence for this head yet. |
| `threads-open` | `pending` | Evidence exists, but review threads are unresolved. |
| `changes-requested` | `failure` | A reviewer objects. Red means objection — never a build failure. |
| (exit 2, no verdict) | *unchanged* | A read failed or config is invalid. Take NO action; retry next pass. |

## ADOPTION PRECONDITION — check this first

A repo must satisfy one, or untested code can merge and this engine will not
stop it:

1. **A merge queue** whose required contexts include the repo's test
   aggregate (recommended — the suite runs once, on the merged result).
2. **No held-back jobs** — every required check runs on every push.

The hazard: held-back jobs report as `skipped`, and GitHub counts skipped as
satisfied. Hold jobs back with no queue and a reviewed PR merges untested.
Proven live in the sandbox (`.agents/skills/review-gate/tests/e2e-sandbox.sh`
scenario 11); that scenario is the safety claim and must pass on every
adopting repo.

## Evidence sources (`.agents/skills/review-gate/scripts/review-predicate.sh`)

Evidence for the CURRENT head is any of:

1. **Review object** at the exact head from a non-author, non-dismissed
   login — restricted to `REVIEW_GATE_REVIEW_OBJECT_TRUSTED_LOGINS` when set,
   and to APPROVED reviews when `REVIEW_GATE_REVIEW_OBJECT_MIN_STATE =
   "approved"`. An approval is never superseded by a later COMMENTED from the
   same reviewer; only a later CHANGES_REQUESTED withdraws it.
2. **Trusted clean-analysis check-run or commit status**
   (`REVIEW_GATE_TRUSTED_STATUS_CONTEXTS`) succeeding on this head — but a
   pass must prove analysis RAN: a success matching
   `REVIEW_GATE_CHECKRUN_SKIP_PATTERNS` (e.g. "rate limited") is
   NOT-EVIDENCE, never a failure. It is silence, which `awaiting` handles.
   On BOTH surfaces the NEWEST row/run per name decides (statuses by list
   order, check-runs by run id): an older clean success never outlives its
   reviewer's newer pending/failed/skip-marked round.
3. **Comment-form clean pass** (`REVIEW_GATE_COMMENT_REVIEWERS`): an issue
   comment by a trusted bot login — never the PR author, even if configured —
   binding the evidence to this head's sha (floor
   `REVIEW_GATE_SHA_PREFIX_FLOOR`).
4. **Operator override** (`REVIEW_GATE_OVERRIDE_CONTEXT`, legacy name
   `REVIEW_GATE_OUTAGE_CONTEXT`): a trusted operator's status carrying a
   NON-EMPTY reason, which is enforced and surfaced in the gate detail.
   Substitutes for MISSING evidence ONLY — it can never override a
   changes-requested or an unresolved thread, so the internal review must fix
   findings and resolve threads first, then attest.

With `REVIEW_GATE_CARRY_FORWARD` (off by default), evidence at an ancestor
carries to head when the delta is provably in a class review would not
re-examine — docs-only, comment-only, identical tree. Never a waiver: real
evidence must exist, code changes always require fresh evidence, and the
fail-closed terms still apply.

Changes-requested and unresolved threads always fail closed. Every evidence
read fails LOUD (exit 2, no verdict) — a transient API error must never flip
a healthy PR's state; reads retry in-process up to `REVIEW_GATE_API_ATTEMPTS`
(default 1), and a zero-byte producer is a failed read, not an empty page
set. Review threads are counted across pages (100 per page, bound 20
pages / 2000 threads); past the bound — or when pagination metadata
cannot advance — the count reports overflow and fails closed to
`threads-open`.

**Trust model.** Trust keys on names only GitHub controls: the author login
of a review or comment, or the exact check/status context on repos where
every publisher is trusted. A comment body never establishes trust — it is
read only to BIND evidence to a commit, so a stale comment cannot vouch for a
later push. Where PR workflows hold `statuses:write`, the opt-in
`REVIEW_GATE_STATUS_PUBLISHER_REJECT` list rejects statuses minted by a
forgeable creator (typically `github-actions[bot]`) on both the
trusted-context and override reads. Statuses are read from the per-commit
statuses LIST endpoint, where every real publisher — GitHub Apps included —
carries a creator login; while the reject list is configured, a status with
no creator login is an anomaly and is not evidence (with the list empty, the
default, the filter is off entirely).

## The writer (`.agents/skills/review-gate/scripts/review-writer.sh`)

One workflow, defined on the default branch, is the only thing that writes
the gate status. It evaluates the predicate and converges the status —
nothing else.

- **Converge-all on every leg.** Every invocation converges EVERY open PR,
  so a run evicted from the concurrency group strands nothing (8 evictions
  observed in one sandbox replay, zero stranded).
- **Relay / converge split.** PR-attached legs (`pull_request_target`,
  `pull_request_review`, `status`, an opted-in `check_run`) do NOT run the
  engine: they run a group-less relay job that dispatches a converge pass
  and exits — in seconds on the success path, up to about 4.2 minutes when
  it has to back off (see Cost). Only `workflow_dispatch` and `schedule` hold the
  single-writer group. Convergence is unchanged — what changes is WHERE an
  eviction's `CANCELLED` check lands. Attached to a PR head it pinned that
  PR at `mergeStateStatus UNSTABLE` until a manual rerun; on the
  default-branch runs the relay dispatches into, nothing gates on it.
  **Cost**: one *non-evictable* run per PR-attached event — seconds and a
  billed minimum on the success path, up to about 4.2 minutes of runner hold
  in the worst modeled failure (a 60s-bounded attempt, a wait capped at 120s
  plus up to 14s of jitter, a second 60s-bounded attempt), inside the job's
  5-minute budget — the relay coalesces nothing, so unlike the writer group
  there is one per event, including every `status` transition from every CI
  provider. Each run also spends one content-creating API request against the
  repo's shared secondary-limit budget; exhausting that budget degrades events
  to the cron floor rather than breaking convergence. Event-fast latency grows
  by a whole extra run lifecycle (two queue + runner-allocation waits instead
  of one): typically seconds, well inside the cron floor's period, and when
  runner allocation exceeds that period the scheduled pass converges the head
  first and the dispatched run is a redundant no-op — an overrun costs a run,
  not convergence. Size that before adopting on a capacity-limited runner
  pool.
  **Residual**: this removes *eviction-driven* cancelled checks, not every
  cancelled check — a relay that hangs to its `timeout-minutes` would still
  be a cancelled check on the PR head, which is why every wait in the step is
  bounded. Its dispatch failures exit green and warn (below) rather than
  redden.
- **The relay never exits non-zero — a pinned invariant, not a per-branch
  choice.** It holds no
  `statuses` scope, so a failed dispatch cannot make the gate look
  converged — only leave it stale, which the cron floor and `pr-watch
  --heal` already own. Reddening would re-create the exact `UNSTABLE` pin
  the split removes. Two dispatch attempts (the retry honors
  a three-way rule. A **rate-limit** answer waits the window the server
  named — `retry-after`, or `x-ratelimit-reset` *only when
  `x-ratelimit-remaining` is 0* — floored at 60s; a secondary limit that
  sends no header is recognized from its body or from an HTTP 429. Every wait
  then carries bounded jitter, because the relay is group-less: without it, N
  runs of one event burst read the same headers and re-POST in lockstep. A
  plain **transient** waits
  5s. A **permanent** answer is not retried at all: 400, 404 for a renamed
  workflow file, 405, 422 for a bad ref, 401 for a revoked token, and 403
  when it carries no rate-limit evidence — the `Resource not accessible by
  integration` shape, which is the likeliest failure a hand-edited
  permissions block produces. A named window beyond the 120s budget is not
  waited out either; both defer to the cron floor. `x-ratelimit-reset` is on
  *every* GitHub response, so treating it as a wait instruction on its own
  silently disables the whole retry); on double failure it
  warns and exits 0. It files no
  rolling incident of its own — a sustained dispatch outage shows up as
  **gate staleness**, which `pr-watch --heal` already reduces across
  every open PR, rather than as N red PRs or a widened relay scope.
- **Write ordering.** Before any `success` post it re-reads the status and
  defers when any gate entry was created at/after this run's evaluation
  instant — a newer run's state AND description (which carries the audit
  detail) both stand; a failed re-read defers too. Downward posts never
  defer.
- **Idempotent.** When the current entry already matches state + description
  it no-ops, so idle cron ticks append nothing.
- **Forks need no special case** — every leg holds a write-capable
  default-branch token. The one exception is `pull_request_review` on a fork
  PR, whose token GitHub downgrades to read-only: it cannot dispatch, so
  that run exits green as a no-op and the cron floor converges it.
- **`pull_request_target` safety**: the job never executes PR-controlled
  code. Every checkout pins the default branch with credentials dropped.

## Operations

**Watching one or many PRs without stalling.** Never key a hand-rolled
monitor on gate-state transitions — a PR sitting steadily at "pending with
open threads" transitions nothing and you sleep through it. Run
`.agents/skills/review-gate/scripts/pr-watch.sh` (optionally `--heal`) on
the harness's wake-up mechanism instead: silence + exit 0 means nothing
needs you; attention
lines name exactly what does. See adoption.md § Watching PRs as an agent.

**Reviewers are down / nothing is reviewing.** Run the internal review loop:
fix findings, resolve every thread, then post the override status with a real
reason. It cannot bypass an objection or an open thread — that is the point.

**A PR that repairs the gate itself.** The writer always runs the merged
engine, so a broken predicate cannot open its own repair PR's gate. Merge it
with the ruleset's bypass actor (every fleet repo has one configured) and say
so in the commit message.

**A settings-change PR** is judged by the OLD config — a PR adding a trusted
login cannot have its own gate honor it. Merge via normal review or the
bypass actor.

## Settings

Every per-repo value is a `REVIEW_GATE_*` key (env > `vstack.settings.toml` >
default). Full table and the security reasoning:
[references/settings.md](references/settings.md).

## Selftest — the engine's portable proof

`.agents/skills/review-gate/scripts/review-predicate-selftest.sh` pins the
decision table offline: a `gh` shim answers from fixtures and applies
`--jq` through real jq, so the
real predicate runs unmodified. Every case ending `approved` is paired with a
near-miss that must not. Two layers: a mechanism layer with forced
configurations, and a configured layer that re-derives the battery from the
invoking repo's own resolved settings — so a repo trusting a different bot
tests its own trust list.

Every consumer's CI must run it as a deliberately **ungated** job (own job,
no `needs`): a broken predicate approves nothing, so a selftest behind the
gate could never run when it matters.

## Adoption

Copy `.agents/skills/review-gate/templates/review-gate-writer.yml` into
`.github/workflows/` (repo-owned after copy; `vstack refresh` does not
sync workflow YAML), set the repo's
`REVIEW_GATE_*` values, add the ungated selftest job, and require the gate
context in the ruleset alongside the test aggregate. Full wiring:
[references/adoption.md](references/adoption.md). An adoption PR deletes the
local machinery it supersedes in the same PR — a redesign removes what it
replaces, never leaves it dormant.

A consumer also merges re-vendor PRs whose entire delta is bytes already
reviewed upstream. Suppress the duplicate findings with the remedy-locus
reviewer instruction, never a reviewer path exclusion — excluding the vendored
tree leaves a pure re-vendor PR with nothing to review, no review object, and a
gate that starves:
[references/vendored-paths.md](references/vendored-paths.md).
