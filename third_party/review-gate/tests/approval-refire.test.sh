# Behavioral tests for the SHIPPED skills/review-gate/scripts/approval-refire.sh
# (the orch test skills/orch/tests/approval_refire.sh exercises the legacy orch
# copy; this one invokes the engine's own script, including its lib/settings.sh
# resolution layer).
#
# The refire runs against a STUBBED review-predicate.sh placed next to it (it
# resolves the predicate relative to itself), so these tests pin the
# convergence branches independently of predicate behavior:
#   r1.  awaiting, no gate status            -> posts pending, no rerun
#   r2.  awaiting, already pending w/ same   -> no-op (no POST)
#        description
#   r3.  changes-requested                   -> posts failure
#   r4.  approved, current status success    -> no-op (no POST, no rerun)
#   r5.  approved, PRIOR success on the sha  -> direct success post, NO rerun
#        (current pending)                      (success-needs-proof fast path)
#   r6.  approved, no prior success          -> full rerun of the head's
#                                               completed pull_request runs;
#                                               NO direct success post
#   r7.  approved, run at MAX_ATTEMPTS cap   -> left alone (no rerun), exit 0
#   r8.  approved, QUIESCE=0, run in         -> no rerun (next sweep pass), exit 0
#        progress
#   r9.  predicate read failure              -> exit 1, NO POST, NO rerun
#   r10. gate-status history read failure    -> exit 1, NO POST, NO rerun
#   r11. missing required env (PR_NUMBER)    -> exit 1
#   r12. custom REVIEW_GATE_CONTEXT: a       -> rerun, not direct success
#        prior success under another            (proof is per-context), and
#        context is not proof                   posts name the custom context
#   r13. threads-open verdict                -> posts pending (downward path)
#   r14. REVIEW_GATE_CONTEXT resolved from   -> posts name the file's context
#        the settings file
#   r15. unparseable settings assignment     -> exit 1, NO POST, NO rerun
#        (TOML array syntax)                    (fail loud, never empty)
