# Assertions on the review-gate WORKFLOW YAML — split out of
# review-writer.test.sh, which is the review-writer.sh engine suite. Two
# instrument classes live here, and they are different kinds of evidence:
#
#   tpl:*    grep-pins on expressions offline runs cannot execute (job-level
#            if:, permissions, triggers, refs, budgets). GitHub evaluates
#            those, so these keep them from being silently dropped or
#            reworded; the eviction behavior they stand for is asserted live
#            in tests/e2e-sandbox.sh.
#   relay:*  the relay step's SCRIPT, extracted from the YAML and EXECUTED
#            against a gh stub — not a pin, the real shell (VST-210).
#
# BOTH RUN AGAINST BOTH COPIES: the shipped template, and the adopted
# .github/workflows/review-gate-writer.yml found by walking up to the
# enclosing repo. That copy is what actually gates PRs and is hand-maintained,
# so template-only assertions would prove the behavior of a file CI never
# runs. In a CONSUMER the adopted copy is normally PRESENT and legitimately
# differs from the template (its own default branch in the ADAPT markers, an
# optional check_run guard) — so the pins and the relay battery run against it
# there too, and every ADAPT-bearing pin asserts the SHAPE the ADAPT preserves
# rather than the catalog's own value; only the catalog additionally pins the
# literal. The whole-file drift check is a self-adoption-only invariant. Only
# the template is asserted when no adopted copy is found at all.
#
# THE RELAY NEVER REDS is the invariant every relay case asserts, over both
# the runner's shells AND over its own environment (each env: binding dropped
# in turn) — a red or a hang on a PR-attached leg is a failed check on the PR
# head, which is the whole defect VST-210 removes.

# the extracted step leaves a stale claim anywhere else in the adopted copy

# is therefore NOT machine-checkable here and stays a review concern; what IS
# checked is that every line of CODE matches once the vendored script path is
# normalized, which is the class that changes behavior.
