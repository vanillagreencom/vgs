# Behavioral tests for the SHIPPED skills/review-gate/scripts/review-writer.sh
# — the single writer, whose entire job is to converge the gate commit
# status to the predicate's verdict. Stubbed GitHub API, every leg driven
# offline.
#
# The writer no longer polices CI (that is branch protection's job — see the
# script header's adoption precondition), so there is no proof chain here to
# test: no rerun, no provenance marker, no attempt floor, no evidence
# ordering, no stall recovery. What remains is the decision table, the write
# discipline, and leg routing.
#
# Verdict -> status:
#   w1.  awaiting, no gate status            -> posts pending
#   w2.  awaiting, already pending w/ same   -> no-op: two evaluations leave
#        description                            ONE entry (idempotence)
#   w3.  changes-requested over a NEWER      -> posts failure directly —
#        success entry                          downward posts never defer
#   w4.  threads-open                        -> posts pending
#   w5.  approved, already success           -> no-op
#   w6.  approved, currently pending         -> posts success
#   w7.  approved, currently failure         -> posts success (a dismissed
#                                               objection reopens the gate)
# Write discipline (VST-65 ordering guard, success posts only):
#   w10. guard re-read shows a non-success   -> defers (exit 0, no POST)
#        entry at/after evaluated_at
#   w10b. same-second non-success write      -> still defers (>=, not >)
#   w10c. newer SUCCESS entry                -> ALSO defers: the description
#                                               carries the audit detail
#                                               (override reason), so a stale
#                                               run must not overwrite it
#   w11. guard re-read FAILS                 -> defers (fail-safe side)
#   w12. downward posts never consult it     -> failure posts over a newer
#                                               entry without deferring
# Fail loud, act never:
#   w21. predicate read failure              -> exit 1, NO POST
#   w22. status-history read failure         -> exit 1, NO POST
#   w23. PR_NUMBER without HEAD_SHA          -> exit 1 (recursive contract)
#   w24. unknown verdict                     -> exit 1, NO POST
# Leg routing (converge-all):
#   w25. WRITER_READ_ONLY=1 (fork            -> exit 0, posts nothing, never
#        pull_request_review no-op)             consults the predicate (a
#                                               broken predicate proves it)
#   w26. merge_group leg                     -> unconditional success post,
#                                               predicate never consulted
#   w27. schedule pass, two open PRs         -> converges BOTH heads
#   w28. one PR failing                      -> exit 1, other PR converged
