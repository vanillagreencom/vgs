# The engine's core test: run the offline selftest end-to-end (it is
# self-contained by design — gh shim + fixtures, no network) and prove both
# of its layers:
#   1. with no repo settings, the full decision table passes on the built-in
#      defaults;
#   2. with a repo-configured trust surface (different bot, different
#      contexts, non-default floor/skip patterns/trust list), the configured
#      layer regenerates its approve/near-miss battery from THOSE values —
#      a repo trusting a different bot tests its own config, not defaults.
#
# Every fixture replays the FULL decision table, and the replays are
# independent (own cwd, own settings, own scratch dir), so they run
# concurrently: each fixture block launches its replay as soon as it is
# built, and the assertions read the recorded outputs after `wait`. Teardown
# runs on EXIT, INT, TERM, HUP and QUIT, and reports what it terminates;
# SIGKILL, the one signal it cannot trap, leaves the replay tree and the
# scratch dir behind, since each replay sits in its own process group rather
# than the runner's.
