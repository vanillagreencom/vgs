# Reviewing byte-pinned vendored paths

For consumers that vendor an upstream tree byte-for-byte and merge re-vendor
PRs. Suppressing duplicate upstream findings is a reviewer-instruction
problem; configuration answers break the gate.

## What suppression must not break

**Evidence.** The gate's evidence term needs a trusted non-author review object
at the exact head, or one of the other forms in [settings.md](settings.md).
`REVIEW_GATE_CARRY_FORWARD` only extends evidence that already exists, and the
vendored tree sits in `REVIEW_GATE_CARRY_FORWARD_EXCLUDE`, forcing fresh
evidence on this PR class.

**Threads.** The predicate counts `reviewThreads`, and the zero-bypass
`required_review_thread_resolution` ruleset enforces the same threads
server-side. Threads come from INLINE review comments. A review submitted with
a body and no inline comments is full evidence and creates no thread — that is
the target shape.

**Honesty.** Never engineer a hollow review object to feed the gate. Where there
is genuinely nothing to review, post the operator override with a reason.

## The trap: reviewer path exclusion

Never exclude the vendored tree in the reviewer's own configuration (content
exclusion, ignore-paths, a path filter on the review trigger):

- A pure re-vendor PR has no other files. With the tree excluded the reviewer
  posts no review object (gate stuck at `awaiting`) or posts a
  reviewed-nothing pass on a trusted context (hollow green).
- **`REVIEW_GATE_CHECKRUN_SKIP_PATTERNS` does not close the second outcome.**
  It is a literal, case-insensitive substring match against the check's title
  plus summary (defaults `rate limited`, `skipped`, `queued`); a summary
  saying only that it reviewed no files matches none of them.
- Mixed PRs still produce a review, so the failure appears only on the pure
  class.

**Never exclude a path that can constitute an entire PR's diff.** The same rule
rules out narrowing a review trigger by path.

## The rule: route by remedy locus, not by path

Classify each finding by where the fix would land, and pick the surface:

| Where the fix lands | Surface |
|---|---|
| A repo-owned file — the vendor pin or checksum manifest, settings, CI wiring, adoption glue | Inline comment. In scope, keep it. |
| The vendored bytes themselves | Review body only. Upstream's call. |
| The vendored bytes, where the bump introduces a production-impacting regression that runs HERE — correctness, security, data loss | Inline comment, and it may block. See the carve-out below. |
| The upstream repo's own docs, config, or conventions | Review body only, or omit. |

The regression carve-out admits only a defect you would hold a release for —
correctness, security, data loss. Style, naming, duplication, test layout,
missing coverage stay in the review body.

An instruction that constrains only the REMEDY ("flag it, but do not ask for
local edits") suppresses nothing: the thread still opens and still blocks.
Constrain the surface.

### Reviewer classes — where a review body exists, and where it does not

Classify per reviewer, not per repo:

- **Summary-capable** — it authors its own review body. An upstream-remedy
  finding goes there and costs no thread.
- **Location-bound** — every finding is anchored to a file and line; its
  review body, where it has one, is a fixed template.

For a location-bound reviewer the rule is a BOUND: at most ONE consolidated
comment per PR carrying every upstream-remedy finding together, anchored
anywhere in the vendored tree.

**Accepted residual.** A reviewer whose output schema binds one finding to one
location will still emit one thread per finding. Read the thread count as an
observable, not as compliance, and answer those threads like any others: **a
location-bound reviewer exceeding one thread is not by itself a failed
rollout.**

Do not build an adapter that collects such findings and republishes them as a
summary.

Classify each of the repo's reviewers before wiring, by reading a review body
it posted on a recent PR: a body identical across PRs is a template, and that
reviewer is location-bound.

## The consumer session's half

Once per re-vendor train, on ONE consumer PR, collect upstream-remedy findings
from BOTH surfaces: the review bodies, AND EVERY vendored-path thread a
location-bound reviewer left.

`kendex report --skill review-gate --title [TITLE] --body-file [PATH]` routes
the report upstream. The command is non-interactive: `--title` is required,
and exactly one of `--body` or `--body-file` must be given — with neither (or
both) it exits without filing. Two further preconditions, each silent when
unmet:

- **The selector is required.** With no `--skill`/`--agent`/`--hook`/`--asset`,
  the CLI warns once that ownership could not be determined and files against
  the LOCAL repo.
- **For a skill, only the installed `SKILL.md` frontmatter decides.** Routing
  needs the vendored `SKILL.md` present at the install path and carrying
  `source: kendex` (or the upstream `repository` slug). A repo that vendored
  only the scripts subtree files locally. Check before relying on it, or open
  the upstream issue by hand.

Do not fix it locally, and do not file the same finding from each consumer.

## Wiring a repo

1. Copy [`../templates/vendored-paths.instructions.md`](../templates/vendored-paths.instructions.md)
   into the repo's path-scoped reviewer instruction directory —
   `.github/instructions/`, as a `*.instructions.md` file — set `applyTo` to the
   repo's actual vendored glob, and fill the placeholders. Repo-owned after the
   copy.
2. Check the glob against the paths a real re-vendor PR touches.
3. **Replace any existing instruction scoped to the same tree — do not add
   alongside it.** Merge any repo-specific carve-outs the old clause held into
   the new body.
4. Classify each reviewer the repo runs as summary-capable or location-bound
   (above). A repo whose reviewers are ALL location-bound gets a bounded
   improvement, not silence — decide whether that is worth the wiring.
5. Mirror the rule in the repo's reviewer-guidance file, for reviewers that do
   not read path-scoped instructions.
6. Change no gate settings. Do not add the vendored tree to a carry class, do
   not remove it from `REVIEW_GATE_CARRY_FORWARD_EXCLUDE`, and do not widen
   `REVIEW_GATE_TRUSTED_STATUS_CONTEXTS` to a CI check as a substitute for
   review.

## Verifying on a real re-vendor PR

Verify per repo, on the first re-vendor PR after the change, and use a PURE
one (vendored files only).

```bash
# 1. Evidence AT HEAD. Read the head in the same call and compare per review.
gh pr view [PR] --repo [OWNER/REPO] --json reviews,headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid as $head | .reviews[] | {login: .author.login, state: .state, at_head: (.commit.oid == $head), body_chars: (.body | length)}'

# 2. Threads on the vendored tree, BEFORE resolving any of them.
.agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh pr-threads [PR] --unresolved

# 3. The gate's own answer for this head.
gh pr checks [PR] --repo [OWNER/REPO]
```

**Under `REVIEW_GATE_THREADS=enforce`** (the default), record step 2's threads
and their authors first, resolve them, then read step 3.

**Under `REVIEW_GATE_THREADS=off`**, read both from ONE snapshot and resolve
nothing. Do not clear real repo-owned threads merely to finish a verification.

Step 1 answers the evidence question only for rows with `at_head` true whose
login is non-author AND in the repo's
`REVIEW_GATE_REVIEW_OBJECT_TRUSTED_LOGINS` (empty list = any non-author), and
only at the repo's `REVIEW_GATE_REVIEW_OBJECT_MIN_STATE`. Under `any` every
such row counts. Under `approved` a login contributes evidence only when its
newest `APPROVED` at head is not followed by a newer `CHANGES_REQUESTED` from
that same login; a bare `COMMENTED` is not evidence there. This view reports
bot logins WITHOUT the `[bot]` suffix the trusted list carries — compare on
the base name, or read the REST `pulls/[PR]/reviews` endpoint, which returns
the suffixed login and `commit_id`.

**Pass**: a trusted non-author review object at the current head; on the
vendored tree, no unresolved thread from a summary-capable reviewer; gate
`success`. A repo-owned finding arriving inline is fine, and so is an inline
thread raising a carve-out regression — read what a thread SAYS before grading
it. Hold or revert the bump, or resolve it on an upstream fix, then re-read; it
is a blocked re-vendor, never a failed rollout. Threads from a location-bound
reviewer are counted and recorded, not graded.

**Suspect, not proven**: threads at zero with `body_chars` also at zero. Treat
it as a prompt to check, and confirm with a signal that distinguishes
exclusion: a summary-capable reviewer's own reviewed-file count in the body
(reviewed N of N changed files), and whether the reviewer's configuration
carries a path exclusion over the vendored tree. For a trusted check-run
passing with a reviewed-nothing summary, read the check's own output rather
than trusting the green.

**On confirmed failure**, revert the instruction file and merge the PR through
the documented review path.
