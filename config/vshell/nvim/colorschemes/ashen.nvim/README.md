# Ashen

_Coding is already hard on the brain, so it should at least be easy on the
eyes._

Ashen is a warm, muted colorscheme that evokes the feeling of embers
sizzling out in an old fire pit. It features red & orange tones, plenty of
grayscale, and hints of teal.

This repository only contains the implementation of Ashen for Neovim. It's
hosted on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ficd/ashen.nvim) and mirrored on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ficcdaf/ashen.nvim) for your convenience.
Please check the main monorepo on
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ficd/ashen) for implementations of Ashen
for other software.

> **Note**: This project is in maintenance mode because I no longer use
> Neovim. I am happy to accept contributions.

## Features

- Warm, cozy, muted palette that's easy on the eyes.
- Incredibly fast load time.
- Optional transparency.
- Palette and highlight group overriding.
- Customizable terminal palette.
- Extensive [plugin](#plugins) support.
- [Extra themes](#extras) for other software.

## Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://lazy.folke.io/):

```lua
{
  "ficcdaf/ashen.nvim",
  -- optional but recommended,
  -- pin to the latest stable release:
  tag = "*",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  -- configuration is optional!
  opts = {
    -- your settings here
  },
}
```

You can load Ashen anywhere in your Neovim configuration. You only need to
call `setup` if you want to change any settings!

```lua
vim.cmd("colorscheme ashen")
-- You may call the load function as well
-- Do NOT call them both; they both do
-- the same thing!
require("ashen").load()
```

If you're using [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/), I recommend the
following:

```lua
return {
  { "ficcdaf/ashen.nvim" },
  {
    "LazyVim/LazyVim",
    opts = {
      colorscheme = "ashen",
    },
  }
}
```

You can also configure `lazy.nvim` to use Ashen while installing plugins:

```lua
require("lazy").setup({
  install = {
    colorscheme = {"ashen"}
  }
})
```

## Plugins

Many plugins are already "supported" because they use standard Neovim
highlight groups. However, some plugins require explicit support from
color schemes. Additionally, some plugins may require extra setup to work
with Ashen. Please see [Plugin Configuration](#plugin-configuration) for
more details.

| Plugin               | Requires Configuration |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| blink.cmp            |                        |
| nvim-cmp             |                        |
| flash.nvim           |                        |
| lualine              | X                      |
| mini.icons           |                        |
| trailblazer.nvim     | X                      |
| obsidian.nvim        |                        |
| oil.nvim             |                        |
| render-markdown.nvim |                        |
| telescope.nvim       |                        |
| minimap.vim          |                        |
| neogit               |                        |
| FzfLua               | X                      |
| fzf.vim              |                        |
| org-bullets.nvim     |                        |
| lazy.nvim            |                        |

## Configuration

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

> [!WARNING]
> If you choose to set any options, please note that `setup` _only_ sets
> up the configuration and does **not** load the theme! You must call
> `colorscheme ashen` or `require("ashen").load()` _after_ `setup`!

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

You can pass an options table to the `setup` function to configure Ashen,
the same you would any other plugin. If you use `lazy.nvim`, you can set
options as shown in [installation](#installation)!

```lua
require("ashen").setup({
  -- your settings here
})
-- theme must be loaded *after* setup!
vim.cmd("colorscheme ashen")
```

The default settings will work for most people. However, extensive
configuration options are provided.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

> [!TIP]
> If you are not changing any of the defaults, avoid calling `setup` or
> setting any `opts` -- your startup time will be faster!

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

All available settings, along with their default values, are listed below.
User provided settings will be merged with the defaults.

<details>
  <summary>Available Settings</summary>

```lua
-- default settings
{
  -- toggle text style options
  ---@type table<StyleName, boolean>
  style = {},
  -- toggle group specific settings
  style_presets = {
    bold_functions = false,
    italic_comments = false,
  },

    ---if not autoload: plugins to LOAD
    ---@type string[]
    override = {},
  },
}
```

</details>

### Style

You can disable _all_ uses of a certain style with the following setting:

```lua
opts = {
  style = {
    bold = false,
    italic = false,
    -- etc...
  },
}
```

### Style Presets

The following presets are available. They are off by default, and you may
choose to enable them in your configuration:

```lua
opts = {
  style_presets = {
    bold_functions = true,
    italic_comments = true,
  },
}
```

### Palette Override

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

You can override any color in Ashen's palette, or set new colors entirely.
The `colors` setting accepts a table of `ColorName = HexCode` pairs, where
they are both strings, with `ColorName` corresponding to an Ashen color,
and `HexCode` being a `#` prefixed hexadecimal color code. For an list of
available color names, please see [colors.lua](./lua/ashen/colors.lua).

Please see the following example:

```lua
opts = {
  colors = {
    background = "#000000",
    red_ember = "#933737"
  },
}
```

</details>

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

> [!TIP]
> Made a palette you're proud of? It could become Ashen's next "theme
> variant" -- don't be afraid to open a feature request for it!

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Highlight Override

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

You can find a detailed explanation of the HighlightMap type below.

<details>
<summary>Explanation of HighlightMap type</summary>

```lua
---@alias HighlightSpec [FgHexCode?, BgHexCode?, Style?]
-- The colors *must* be in this ^^^ order. If you want
-- to set a background but no foreground, you MUST pass
-- nil for the FgHexCode!
-- example:
{ "#FFFFFF" } -- set only foreground
{ "#FFFFFF", "#000000" } -- set foreground and background
{ nil, "#000000" } -- set only background

-- Please see `:h nvim_set_hl()` -> {val}
-- for the possible style table options.
---@alias Style table<string, boolean|string|integer>
-- example:
{ bold = true, underline = true }

-- You may pass a style table as the LAST element
-- of a HighlightSpec.
{ "#FFFFFF", "#000000", { bold = true, underline = true } }
-- The style table can be the only element, too.
{ { bold = true, underline = true } }
-- Or you may pass a "normalized" table as well:
{ fg = "#FFFFFF", bold = true }


---@alias HighlightMap table<HighlightName, HighlightSpec>
-- Example of a HighlightMap:
{
  Normal = { "#FFFFFF", "#000000", { bold = true, underline = true } },
  ["@function.macro"] = { "#B14242" },
}
```

</details>

Users can override Ashen's highlight group definitions, or set new ones
entirely. There are two options under the `hl` setting: `force_override`
and `merge_override`.

The former will _completely_ overwrite the given highlight group; existing
properties are **not** preserved. An empty table `{}` means Ashen will
_clear_ that highlight group.

The latter will _merge_ properties: it will override _only_ the properties
you specify, and keep non-conflicting Ashen defaults.

You can also _link_ arbitrary highlight groups. Links defined in `hl.link`
take priority over all other links set by Ashen. `hl.link` must be a
key-value table in which the key is the link's _origin_ and the value is
its _target_.

Note that both **hexadecimal color codes** and **Ashen color names** are
valid inputs for color parameters.

```lua
-- full example
hl = {
  -- overwrite every field
  ---@type HighlightMap
  force_override = {
    Normal = { "red_ember", "#000000", { bold = true, underline = true } },
  },
  -- keep untouched fields
  ---@type HighlightMap
  merge_override = {
    ["@function.macro"] = { "#B14242" },
  },
  ---@type table<HighlightName, HighlightName>
  link = {
    -- link FlashBackdrop to Normal
    FlashBackdrop = "Normal",
  },
},
```

</details>

### Terminal Palette

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

The following explanation of the terminal palette applies to both the
Neovim terminal and some [extra](#extras) themes.

<details>
<summary>Explanation of terminal palette</summary>

The palette for the built-in Neovim terminal follows the standard 16-color
Xterm palette. `ashen.nvim` sets these to the same colors as in the
terminal theme [extras](#extras).

Note that, by default, many palette colors do not match their expected
"names" -- for example, `green` is set to a shade of orange. This is to
stay consistent with Ashen's visual identity; while Ashen does _have_ a
green color in its Neovim palette, setting it in the terminal theme
results in an overuse of the color; which appears jarring in contrast with
how Ashen looks in Neovim.

Furthermore, note that the `bright` colors (except `bright black`) are set
to the _same_ color codes as their "regular" counterparts. This is for
consistency with Ashen's minimal Neovim palette -- as a design goal, the
terminal themes should not appear jarring next to the standard Neovim
theme.

The default terminal palette is carefully selected to maintain the visual
feel while retaining important semantic meanings, such as `red` and
`yellow` for errors and warnings in compiler output.

A mapping of index to Xterm color names is provided below.

| Index | Color          |
| ----- | -------------- |
| 0     | black          |
| 1     | red            |
| 2     | green          |
| 3     | yellow         |
| 4     | blue           |
| 5     | magenta        |
| 6     | cyan           |
| 7     | white          |
| 8     | bright black   |
| 9     | bright red     |
| 10    | bright green   |
| 11    | bright yellow  |
| 12    | bright blue    |
| 13    | bright magenta |
| 14    | bright cyan    |
| 15    | bright white   |

</details>

The `terminal.colors` field of the `opts` table should be a mapping of
Xterm indexes to hexadecimal color codes. Please note that the indexes are
a C-style zero indexed array and _not_ a Lua array - the count starts from
`0`, not `1`!

```lua
---@alias AnsiMap table<integer, HexCode> -- where integer ∈ [0, 15]
```

Please see the following example:

```lua
terminal = {
  colors = {
    -- override black
    [0] = "#000000",
    -- override bright green
    [11] = "#AADB1E",
  },
}
```

</details>

### Plugin Integration Settings

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Plugin integration settings can be set under the `opts.plugins` table:

```lua
{
  plugins = {
    autoload = true,
    ---@type string[]
    override = {},
  },
}
```

#### Autoload

By default, plugin integrations are automatically loaded. To disable this
behaviour, you can set `plugins.autoload` to `false`.

<details>
<summary>Exceptions</summary>

- `trailblazer` needs to be loaded manually even if
  `plugins.autoload == true`.

</details>

#### Manual Loading

You can manually load any plugin integration on-demand in your Neovim
config by using the `load_plugin` function. The same naming rules apply as
for `plugins.override`, please see below for more details.

```lua
-- example
require("ashen.plugins").load_plugin("flash")
```

#### Override

You can provide a list of plugin names as an "override". The names must
match the filenames in [lua/ashen/plugins](./lua/ashen/plugins/), with the
`.lua` extension removed, and exclude `init.lua`.

For example:

```lua
{
  -- flash.nvim
  "flash",
  -- mini.icons
  "mini-icons",
}
```

Overriding behaves differently depending on whether autoloading is
enabled. If `plugins.autoload` is set, the overridden plugins will **not**
be loaded automatically. If autoloading is disabled, the overridden
plugins **will** be loaded automatically.

</details>

## Plugin Configuration

### FzfLua

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

If FzfLua's colors aren't looking quite right, please make sure that you
have disabled `fzf_colors` in the settings:

```lua
{
  "ibhagwan/fzf-lua",
  opts = {
    -- must be false for the Ashen
    -- integration to work properly!
    fzf_colors = false,
  },
}
```

</details>

### Lualine

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Ashen comes with a preconfigured Lualine theme that includes a word
counter for Markdown, Text, and Latex files. Optionally,
[noice.nvim](https://github.com/folke/noice.nvim) is used to indicate
Macro recording status, and
[pomo.nvim](https://github.com/epwalsh/pomo.nvim) is supported. The
following is an example of how to configure Lualine to use Ashen:

```lua
return {
  "nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim",
  -- ensure Ashen is loaded first
  dependencies = {
    "ficcdaf/ashen.nvim",
  },
  opts = function()
    local ashen = require("ashen.plugins.lualine").lualine_opts
    -- you can set any other options
    -- expected by lualine, since this
    -- table will be passed directly to `setup`
    ashen.extensions = { "lazy", "fzf" }
    return ashen
  end,
}
```

> I am working on improving the word counter and releasing it as a
> separate plugin. When that happens, Ashen will be updated to support it
> out of the box.

</details>

### Trailblazer.nvim

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Trailblazer tends to overwrite the highlight groups set by Ashen.
Therefore, you may need to invoke Ashen's Trailblazer setup immediately
_after_ loading Trailblazer. Please see the following example:

```lua
return {
  "LeonHeidelbach/trailblazer.nvim",
  event = "UIEnter",
  -- ensure Ashen is loaded first
  dependencies = {
    "ficcdaf/ashen.nvim",
  },
  config = function()
    require("trailblazer").setup({
      -- your Trailblazer setup here
    })
    -- This ensures Ashen's HL groups are set up
    -- AFTER Trailblazer sets its own.
    require("ashen.plugins").load_plugin("trailblazer")
  end,
}
```

</details>

### Render-markdown.nvim

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Ashen will support `render-markdown` OOTB with no additional
configuration. You may optionally consider including the following icons
in your setup. Note they may not render properly in all browsers.

```lua
-- as part of render-markdown.nvim setup
opts = {
  bullet = {
    -- cleaner bullet points
    icons = { "•", "∙" },
  },
  heading = {
    -- Icons that say H1, H2, etc.
    icons = { "󰉫 ", "󰉬 ", "󰉭 ", "󰉮 ", "󰉯 ", "󰉰 " },
  },

}
```

</details>

## Extras

Ashen is available for many other programs. You can find them in the main
repository, [sr.ht/~ficd/ashen](https://sr.ht/~ficd/ashen).
