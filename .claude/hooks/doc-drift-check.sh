# event: Stop
# matcher:
# description: Blocks a stop once per set of stale documents — the documents covering changed code that did not change — so the agent, the only party that can update them, is the one given the list. The refusal opens with `doc-drift-check: stale=<count>` and `doc-drift-check: base=<ref>` — the ref it compared against, or `default-branch`, `none` or `unrelated` — and names each document under them; stdout carries nothing and no user-facing notice is written. The set is recorded as `<git common dir>/kendex/doc-drift/<session_id>-<digest of the sorted set>`, so a later stop naming that same set passes and an agent that read the list and changed nothing is not asked again; a set that gains or loses a document is a different set and blocks once. `stop_hook_active` true passes. Uses the nearest tracked non-root AGENTS.md and architecture topic Covers entries. Compares the branch with its default-branch merge-base, or the working tree when no comparison applies. Claude Code only.
# summary: Stops an agent at the end of its turn when documents covering the code it changed did not change, and hands it the list.
# safety: Reads the payload, git state and the topic files; the only write is the per-set marker under the repository's git common dir. Exit 2 names the documents and asks for each to be confirmed or updated, never bypassed. jq reads the payload and a sha256 tool names the set; every command the hook runs is checked before it is called, the payload readers ahead of the payload and the rest after `stop_hook_active` has been read, so a discovery command's absence costs one retry rather than refusing the retry too; only a missing payload reader refuses that as well, the flag being in the payload it cannot read. A payload, git state or marker the hook cannot read or write is refused, never passed. Every refusal opens with `doc-drift-check: <key>=<value>`; what a command this hook runs writes is captured at the site and replayed under that line, so nothing precedes the key.
