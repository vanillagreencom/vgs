"""Executable checks for bin/vshell_wallpaper_thumbs.py.

The rail's thumbnails are built by a three-rung ladder — Pillow, then
ImageMagick, then ffmpeg — and only the Pillow rung names its output format
explicitly. The other two read the format off the destination's final
extension, so a temp path ending in a timestamp made ffmpeg refuse outright
("Unable to choose an output format") and every build failed on exactly the
installs the ladder exists for. `build_one` answers a failure with None and
every caller falls back to the original, so the whole cache stayed empty in
silence.

MUST-FAIL CONTROLS (each seen red before the fix landed):
  * the temp path's `.jpg` suffix removed — the ffmpeg rung stops producing a
    file at all, which is the shipped bug
  * a rung producing something that is not a JPEG

These execute the real module against a real tracked wallpaper. They pin
BEHAVIOUR, not source text.
