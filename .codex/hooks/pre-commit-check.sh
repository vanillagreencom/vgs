# description: On a git commit, defer to the working directory's armed git hooks — both pre-commit and commit-msg, marked and executable (kendex guard install arms them). Otherwise the commit is refused naming that command: arming is the local act that says a person wants this repository's committed scripts run on their commits, and this hook never runs them on their behalf. Where one is armed, a command that sidesteps it with git's no-verify flag, -n, or a core.hooksPath override is refused: git would skip the commit-msg hook too, and nothing here can check the message. Gates the working directory only: a commit aimed at another repository is gated by that repository's own armed hook, and by nothing here.
# safety: Refuses a commit from a working directory with no armed git pre-commit hook rather than running that repository's own scripts to check it, and refuses a command that bypasses an armed hook (no-verify, -n) or injects git configuration that could (any -c, --config-env, or GIT_CONFIG_* word — core.hooksPath and include.path among them); a commit aimed at another repository is that repository's armed hook's to gate.

# `--config-env` word, a `GIT_CONFIG_*` assignment — can point git at
# hooks this lane did not inspect, by `core.hooksPath` directly or by an
# `include.path` that loads it, so the whole class is refused rather
# than one spelling of it — and so is a `git config` write of
# core.hooksPath in the same command, which disarms the hook before the
# commit reaches it (the key is matched in any case, whatever options
# stand between `config` and it). One of
# those words from some other command on the line costs a refusal to
# reword, never an unchecked commit.

# Armed is our marker in both hook files, in the directory git reads with
# nothing redirecting it, in files git will actually run. That is the whole

#
# The execute bit is git's rule about hook files, not this package's about
# their contents: git skips a hook without one, silently, so deferring to a
# marker in a file git ignores stands this lane aside for nothing at all.
#
# It used to be a taxonomy: is the value empty, does it name this
# repository's own directory under another spelling, does the file look
# executable, does its content parse as something that reaches our scripts.
# Every one of those questions was another way to answer "armed" about a
# repository that was not, and several of them did. So: the marker, or not
# armed. A `core.hooksPath` set to anything at all is not armed, because
# deciding otherwise is the taxonomy that kept being wrong — and this lane
# would rather check a commit twice than wave one through.
# Exit 1 is git for "not set", and it is the only answer that means
# unredirected. A git that failed for any other reason — a broken config
# exits 128 — prints nothing either, so testing the OUTPUT read a
# repository nobody could measure as one with hooks where this lane
# expects them. Status decides, and anything unmeasured is not armed,
# which refuses the commit rather than standing aside for a gate that was
# never established.
