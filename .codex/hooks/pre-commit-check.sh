# description: On a git commit, defer to the working directory's armed git pre-commit hook (kendex guard install arms one); where none is armed there, run the kendex guard pre-commit chain — format, lint, and commit guards — from the working directory as the fallback gate. Where one is armed, a command that sidesteps it with git's no-verify flag, -n, or a core.hooksPath override is refused: git would skip the commit-msg hook too, and no fallback here can check the message. Gates the working directory only: a commit aimed at another repository is gated by that repository's own armed hook, and by nothing here.
# safety: Prevents committing unchecked code from the working directory when it has no armed git pre-commit hook, and refuses a command that bypasses an armed hook (no-verify, -n) or injects git configuration that could (any -c, --config-env, or GIT_CONFIG_* word — core.hooksPath and include.path among them) rather than half-checking it; a commit aimed at another repository is that repository's armed hook's to gate.

# feedback, never a check — and `git log --grep=commit` merely pays for a

# hooks this lane did not inspect, by `core.hooksPath` directly or by an

# stand between `config` and it). One of
# those words from some other command on the line costs a refusal to
